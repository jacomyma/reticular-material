Power law,,Pareto distribution is a specific case of the power law,The Pareto principle is an example of the power law,Yule-Simon distribution is an example of the power law,Log-normal distributions are often mistaken for power-law distributions,Power law is a type of heavy-tail distribution,the 80-20 rule is an example of the power law,Zipf's law is an example of the power law,The power law has a long tail,
Pareto distribution,Pareto distribution is a specific case of the power law,,The Pareto principle holds for a specific value of the Pareto index,,The Pareto distribution and log-normal distribution are alternative distributions for describing the same types of quantities,,"The ""80-20 rule"" is a colloquial name of the Pareto distribution",Zipf's law is the discrete version of the Pareto distribution,The long-tail is a characteristic of a specific graphial representation of the Pareto distribution,The Matthew principle is a colloquial name of the Pareto distribution
Pareto principle,"The Pareto principle is an illustration of a ""power law"" relationship",The Pareto principle is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto distributions,,,,,The Pareto principle is also known as the 80/20 rule,,,
Yule-Simon distribution,,,,,,,,Yule–Simon distribution is a realization of Zipf's law,,
Log-normal distribution,,,,,,,,,,
Heavy-tailed distribution,,the Pareto distribution is a common heavy-tailed distribution,,,the log-normal distribution is a common heavy-tailed distribution,,,,the long-tailed distributions are an important subclass of the heavy-tailed distributions,
80-20 rule,,,REDIRECTS TO,,,,,,,
Zipf's law,Zipfian distribution is a discrete power law probability distribution,The Zipf's distribution is a discrete analogous to the Pareto distribution,,,,A Zipf distribution can model a heavy-tailed distribution,,,,
Long tail,The long tail is the name for a long-known feature of some statistical distributions such as power laws,The long tail is the name for a long-known feature of some statistical distributions such as the Pareto distribution,Long tail distributions have a bigger tail than the Pareto principle,,,Long-tail distributions are a subtype of heavy-tailed distributions,,The long tail is the name for a long-known feature of some statistical distributions such as Zipf's distribution,,

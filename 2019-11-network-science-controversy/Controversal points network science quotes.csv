A. How actors frame the controversy,,,,,,,,,
A disciplinary divide,,,,,"""Simply speaking, there are two camps: those seeing scale-freeness as an emergent property, and those seeing it as a statistical property. My very cartoony summary is as follows: [emergentists vs. Statisticalists]"" (Holme, 2018b)","""For Vespignani, the debate illustrates a gulf between the mindsets of physicists and statisticians, both of whom have valuable perspectives."" (Klarreich, 2018)","""Listening to the discussion that followed, I found that it was roughly aligned along a disciplinary divide."" (Barzel, 2018)",,
How researchers enact public relations,"""A more important second point, however, relates to how good Barabasi is at generating [public relations]."" (Venkatasubramanian, 2005)","""Barabasi is not one to shy away from grand claims of universality. As such, he epitomizes the thing that many of those outside of the discipline hate about physicists, i.e., their apparent arrogance."" (Clauset, 2005b)",,,,,"""I personally felt at times that my work was criticized, by referees or by peers (or by my wife), due to its reliance on idealized versions of complex systems."" (Barzel, 2018)",,"""The author's conclusion that ‘scale-free networks are rare,’ is turned into the title of the preprint, helping it to get maximal attention. It worked—Quanta magazine accepted its conclusions without reservations. After The Atlantic carried the article, the un-refereed preprint received a degree of media exposure that the original discovery of scale-free networks never enjoyed."" (Barabási, 2018)"
Conceptual ambiguity,,,"""the term “scale-free network” can confusingly refer to either a network with a power-law degree distribution or a network built by preferential attachment. This ambiguity has not helped resolve the controversy over the universality of scale-free networks"" (Broido and Clauset, 2018)","""[Scale-freeness] actually did mean something very clear once … the claim just sort of slowly morphs to conform to all the evidence"" (Klarreich, 2018)","""Can we find consensus? A first step would obviously be to agree on a precise definition."" (Holme, 2019)",,,,
B. Perspectives on scale-freeness,,,,,,,,,
Contrasting the log-normal and  power-law distributions is POSSIBLE,,,"However, identifying that form from empirical data can be non-trivial, e.g., because log-normals often fit degree distributions as well or better than power laws. (Broido and Clauset, 2018)","""The version of “heavy-tailed” that is close enough to “scale-free” for many properties to transfer over is not an especially broad class of networks"" (Klarreich, 2018)",,,,,
Contrasting the log-normal and  power-law distributions is IMPOSSIBLE,"""lognormal and power law distributions connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many field"" (Mitzenmacher, 2004)","""the heart of the data-analysis based critique of Barabasi's work lies in distinguishing two different kinds of heavy-tailed distributions: the log-normal and the power law. Because of a heavy tail is an asymptotic property, these two distributions can be extremely difficult to differentiate when the data only spans a few orders of magnitude (as is the case here)."" (Clauset, 2005b)",,,,,,"""the observation that a lognormal distribution offers an equally good fit … has little hope to be conclusive until considerably longer records of
email patterns become available."" (Barabási, 2005)",
Scale-freeness requires more  rigorous statistical procedures,,"""In this case, Stouffer, Malmgren and Amaral utilize Bayesian model selection to eliminate the power law as a model, and instead show that the distributions are better described by a log-normal distribution. This idea of the importance of good tools and good statistics is something I've written on before."" (Clauset, 2005a)","""A claim that some network is scale free should thus be established using a severe statistical test that goes beyond static degree distributions."" (Broido and Clauset, 2018)",,"""researchers typically plotted distributions in a double-logarithmic scale. … Replacing that method—inexact and prone to motivational biases—was a great merit of [Clauset et al. (2009)]"" (Holme, 2019)",,"""I think Broido and Clauset made a crucial advance."" (Barzel, 2018)",,
A basic test of scale-freeness  provides scientific value,"""From a more pragmatic point of view, it might be reasonable to use whichever
distribution makes it easier to obtain results."" (Mitzenmacher, 2004)","""I think it's okay to publish a results that is merely suggestive so long as it is honestly made, diligently investigated and embodies a compelling and plausible story"" (Clauset, 2005b)",,,"""I, and (I believe) most colleagues, were following the principle that “knowledge of whether or not a distribution is heavy-tailed is far more important than whether it can be fit using a power law”"" (Holme, 2019)","""an over-zealous approach to “fitting” loses the focus on the main conceptual issue. ... Lengthy debates on how accurate an exponent is, if at all measurable, are therefore a kind of academic exercise that misses the crucial point: the real world is in many cases better approximated by heavy-tailed graphs."" (Barrat et al., 2008)","""Essentially, scientific models are designed to offer a smoothed out, idealized description of a reality that is blurred by wrinkles, spikes and sharp corners. … Scale free networks are no exception. … they provide meaningful insight, even if they only offer a pale approximation of the exact, endlessly complicated, network statistics."" (Barzel, 2018)",,"""Given the complexity of real systems, how can we detect the scale-free property of a real network? … if all we want is to see are the consequences of the scale-free property, we can ... measure the variance of the degree distribution."" (Barabási, 2018)"
C. Epistemic tensions,,,,,,,,,
Key notions are lacking falsifiability,,"""Barabasi's work ... does not show causality, nor does it provide falsifiable hypotheses by which it could be invalidated. Barabasi's work in this case is suggestive but not explanatory, and should be judged accordingly. To me, it seems that the contention over the result derives partly from the overstatement of its generality"" (Clauset, 2005b)","""The tacit and common assumption that all networks are scale-free and it’s up to us to figure out how to see them that way — that sounds like a nonfalsifiable hypothesis” (Klarreich, 2018)","""Scale-freeness “actually did mean something very clear once, and almost certainly that definition does not apply to very many things,” Watts said. But instead of network scientists going back and retracting the early claims, he said, “the claim just sort of slowly morphs to conform to all the evidence, while still maintaining its brand label surprise factor. That’s bad for science.”"" (Klarreich, 2018)",,,,,
Empirical measures only make sense when backed by a model,,,,,,,,"""Given that Ref [1] fails to propose an alternative
mechanism indicating that a lognormal distribution could also emerge in a model with
relevance to the discussed human communication patterns, the observation that a lognormal distribution offers an equally good fit for some users is a mere exercise in
statistics"" (Barabási, 2005)","""if we wish to obtain an accurate fit to the degree distribution of a real network, we first must build a generative model that analytically predicts the functional form of P(k). ... it makes no sense to fit indiscriminately a power law to all of them. One must fit the distribution that the theory predicts, which is predictably different for each system."" (Barabási, 2018)"

        <h4>Five elements of an AI business case</h4>
        <div>
          There are five critical elements the business executive needs to include in a business case for an AI solution, and AI implementations fail if the responsible business executive does not detail these five areas.More and more business executives are facing their first AI business case. Executives such as CHROs (Chief Human Resource Officers), CFOs, CMOs, or CSCOs (Chief Supply Chain Officers).They need to create an AI business case with limited experience, if any, within their organization. The IT organization will likely handle the business case's complex technical aspects, whereas the business executive is left with detailing the AI solution's business impact.There are five critical elements the business executive needs to include in a business case for an AI solution. They are 1) the business problem solved by AI, 2) the details of the AI solution, 3) Scalability &amp; maintenance, 4) AI Financials, and 5) the stakeholders. AI implementations fail if the responsible business executive does not detail these five areas.The classical business caseHowever, before looking at these five elements, it is essential to understand that an AI project's business case will deviate from classical business cases in four distinct areas. These four areas are:First, AI is a ''discovery-driven'' investment, resulting in a business case with no clearly defined KPIs. The reason is that there is a limited history of use cases, knowledge, and data about AI implementations in most organizations. As a result, business executives need to address two challenges. First, the executive responsible for the AI project and the CFO or finance organization must understand that this is not a traditional business case. The risk profile of an AI business case is different. If the AI project risks are not made explicit, the project may get defunded. Secondly, the business case's key executives will need to determine the business case metrics and track them. These KPIs will likely be less standard KPIs or less robust in the initial business case.Second, AI projects are cross-functional projects. They often involve more business functions in addition to the IT function than the average IT project. Therefore, project and business case governance is more complex, the budget impact is broader, and the need for collaboration higher. When creating an AI business case, ensure that the project's governance is detailed, the effect on budgets across the organization is agreed upon, and the implementation plan includes dealing with the need for communication across the organization to enable frictionless collaboration.Third, ensure that the data environment is ready for implementation. AI projects far too often stall or even fail because the data is not available or not usable as-is. Information is collected for a purpose and in a format that supports a specific analysis. As a result, the data may not support new forms of analysis intended for the AI solution proposed. Every AI business case needs to highlight the importance of pre-existing quality and relevant data or include a budget to ensure that such a dataset is created as part of the business case.Fourth and last, the AI business case needs to include provisions for the appropriate skills and leadership knowledge to execute the project and subsequently manage the environment when in production. This may result in the need to hire more data science or developer expertise and include costs for developing organizational and leadership competencies.Once an organization has internalized these four differences in AI business cases, they can work on the details required in the five elements of an AI business case.Five elements of an AI business caseThere is extensive coverage of AI business case development from a technical perspective, including the challenges around the data environment, what a business case needs to consider concerning the overall system architecture, and critical security, risk, and governance. But there is only limited coverage of the business elements for the AI business case. Below are five factors to consider as part of every business case for an AI implementation.The business problem: The first but obvious question is what business problem or opportunity are you solving? While this seems a trivial question, far too often, the actual business problem is not clearly articulated. As a consequence, it becomes harder to measure the impact or result of the project. This statement applies to any project, but because most organizations are still learning about AI's use and effects, it is even more critical for AI projects. A clear articulation of the business problem to be solved and how to measure the project's impact is the first step to get approval for an AI project, especially if the finance organization is not experienced in ''discovery-driven'' investments.The solution: Spending time on detailing the actual AI solution is the second area of focus. This is critical for several reasons. These include the fact that most projects are new to the organization, so what the solution is, how it will work, at scale, and who will be involved in using the solution will be new to the organization. Ensure that the solution fits as part of the organization's overall strategy and is linked to the key leaders'objectives and their organizations implementing the solution.Scalability &amp; Maintenance: Most AI projects are initiated as a smaller POC project with the intent of scaling the solution rapidly. The business case must outline how to scale the solution, technically, business-wise, and on the required skills. Lastly, the necessary training and development needed within the organization implementing the solution. Furthermore, maintenance of the full-scale solution is more complicated with AI projects since the algorithms evolve as well the regulatory and legal environments around AI. Lastly, be realistic with the timelines for the scalability of the AI project. An initial review of projects over the last three years shows that most organizations are overly optimistic about implementation and scalability timelines.Financials: The AI business will need to be approved by the finance organization, as is the case for any project. Given that most AI business cases lack well-proven and standard data and metrics used in traditional business cases, the finance organization will often challenge the business case because it is a ''discovery-driven'' investment. Consider whether simulating data where non exists could be a possible option. Approaching the AI business case as a venture capitalist is a wise approach, thus assuming less qualified KPIs, a clear, quantifiable identification of risks, and an iterative approach to proving the business value as you scale the solution. Lastly, the business case's financial part should also define possible failure criteria, so these are clear from the outset.Stakeholders: AI projects involve more stakeholders than traditional IT projects. In addition to several entities within the IT organization, there will be several business stakeholders. The critical stakeholder will be the organization implementing the solution, but the HR organization and the legal organization will likely need to be involved. Thus, ensuring a broader stakeholder communication plan and continuous reporting is a critical part of the AI business case.There will be other factors to include in an AI business case, but the five above are the most critical to have in the business case any organization builds. Also, understand that all business case documents should be treated as live documents, especially AI business cases.CEOs and senior business executives need to appreciate that AI business cases will differ from traditional business cases in several ways. This is one of several critical areas that need to be addressed if AI implementations are to scale across all organizations' sizes.

        <h4>The Fascinating Relationship between AI and Neuroscience</h4>
        <div>
            They inspire and advance together which benefits both fields. Hong Jing Khok Ph.d. student Alibaba 2. apr 2020 04:47 Brødtekst With so much at stake, the need for the field of neuroscience and AI to come together is now more urgent than ever before. - DeepMind In this article, we are going to explore this topic in two ways. How neuroscience inspires AI and how AI advances neuroscience. How neuroscience inspires AI Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence. It has been an inspiration for building human-like AI. There are two ways that neuroscience inspires us to design AI systems. One, that emulates human intelligence, and two, to build neural networks that mimic brain structure. AI systems that emulate human intelligence Recent artificial intelligence advancements are taking the media by storm by performing impressive feats such as: These machines can perform tasks and solve problems better than us, achieving performance that rivals or even exceeds human capability. However impressive these may seem to be, they are only designed to excel in their intended functions. We are still decades away from building artificial human intelligence. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these artificial intelligence systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. For a machine to learn or think like a person , it would need to be able to: explain and understand problems learning-to-learn for acquiring knowledge generalise knowledge to new tasks and situations In a study by KAIST , researchers have developed a computational and neural mechanism for human meta reinforcement learning. As humans, we can adapt to complexity and uncertainty when we are making decisions. Researchers aim to build models that can make decisions like us and solve problems in the same way that humans do. Their discoveries have opened up the possibility that advances in technology might lead to building machines that are more human-like. It is an ongoing pursuit to build machines that have truly human-like learning abilities and cognition, that can learn and think as we do. For example, even with our eyes covered, we may still play the guitar well. But for an artificial intelligence system to play the guitar in a new environment (i.e. with &quot;eyes&quot; covered), it might not do as well. Build neural networks that mimic brain structure We borrowed inspiration from the structure of a human brain to design the neural networks we know today. The idea of neurons in neural networks has similar characteristics to the biological neurons in the brain. A human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, each individually linked to other neurons. Biological neurons are cells: when one gets activated, it generates a spike and sends signals to other neurons. Like a human brain, the machine learning neural network also consists of interconnected neurons. When a neuron receives inputs, it gets activated and it sends information to other neurons. Illustration: wikipedia Illustration: wikipedia artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons [ wikipedia ] Our brain's plasticity allows us to learn and improve our skills. Every time we learn new things, we are creating and strengthening the connections between neurons. That's why when we practise a task, we become better at it. Similarly, a neural network learns when we feed it with lots of data. Each connection on the neural network is associated with a weight that dictates the importance between neurons. During the training process, the weights are tuned accordingly to strengthen or weaken the connection between neurons. For example, when we look at a picture of a cat, we know that it is a cat because we have seen enough cats in our lives. Likewise, if we provide our neural networks with enough cat images, it will start to recognise cats. After understanding how neuroscience inspires AI in emulating human intelligence and building neural networks that mimic brain structure, we are going to explore how AI, in turn, advances neuroscience. How AI advances neuroscience Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming an invaluable tool in neuroscience. It helps us to understand how the human brain works and to accelerate neuroscience development. AI helps us to understand how our brain works Neuroscientists are researching how the human brain processes thoughts and how it moves our bodies. By knowing more about the brain, we are equipped to better diagnose mental diseases and enable people with disabilities to improve movement capabilities The advancement of artificial intelligence systems can help drive neuroscience forward and unlock the secrets of the brain. It allows neuroscientists and researchers to build better models to simulate the human brain. Neural networks are acting as &quot; virtual brains &quot; that capture the representation of our brain. These virtual brains can produce patterns of neural activities that resemble the patterns recorded from the brain. These patterns allow neuroscientists to test hypotheses and observe the results from simulations before investing more resources for actual testing on animals and humans. However, the way artificial intelligence systems work is vastly different from our brain. Neural networks are only a rough analogy of how the brain works, it models neurons as numbers in a high dimensional matrix. But in reality, our brain is a piece of sophisticated biological machinery that uses chemical and electrical activity. That makes us different from machines. AI accelerates neuroscience development and discoveries Machine learning's main strength lies in the ability to recognise patterns in complex data. Complexity is especially true when it comes to analysing our human minds. The signals from the brain are really complicated. With the advancement of machine learning, neuroscientists are cracking the secrets of how billions of brain neurons work together. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures activity in our brain by detecting changes in the blood flow. It generates high dimensional snapshots of brain activity every second. Using machine learning to analyse data helps to uncover the patterns in brain activities which speeds up research work. Machine learning also helps us develop applications that were thought not possible before. Korean University designed an experimental environment for controlling a lower-limb exoskeleton. Users can control the exoskeleton by focusing their attention by staring at blinking lights. Neuroscience and artificial intelligence The human brain is the paramount inspiration for building human-like artificial intelligence. AI researchers use ideas from neuroscience to build new algorithms. On the flip side, artificial intelligence accelerates research in neuroscience. Neuroscientists learn from the behaviour of artificial agents to interpret our brains. I'm optimistic about the future of this partnership between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We urge researchers in neuroscience and AI to find a common language, allowing a free flow of knowledge that will allow continued progress on both fronts. - DeepMind This was orginally posted on my blog where you can find more posts about AI and my research.

        <h4>The U.S. Gets Serious About Catching Up to China in R&amp;D</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a few years now, commentators (including myself) have been calling for a big boost in research spending by the U.S. federal government. In their book &quot;Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream,&quot; economists Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson called for devoting $100 billion a year to develop a network of new research centers around the country. A team at the Brookings Institution came up with a more modest but still substantial plan for $10 billion a year, funneled through universities. Big ideas like this often tend to languish for years or decades before legislators decide to take a stab at implementing them - if they ever do. In this era of partisan posturing, that seems especially likely to happen. But amazingly, a bipartisan group of legislators is acting on the idea of major new research spending. The Endless Frontier Act would spend more than $20 billion a year on upgrading the National Science Foundation, to be renamed the National Science and Technology Foundation, with greatly expanded missions, powers and facilities. Drawing on plans like those of Brookings and Gruber and Johnson, the agency's new technology directorate would create a series of research centers, based at existing universities, focusing on 10 key areas of technology. This is a great move because leveraging existing universities will yield much more bang for the buck than trying to build new research parks. It will also help preserve research universities and the college towns around them. For the past few decades, universities have counted on increasing tuition to fund faculty salaries, graduate-student stipends, new research facilities and other research inputs. But enrollment of high-paying foreign students and state university funding both probably are in long-term decline. So federal funding needs to step in to sustain the research that in turn sustains both U.S. technological leadership and regional economies. One thing that's encouraging is that the Endless Frontier Act also budgets $2 billion a year for creating technology hubs in economically distressed regions (though it's not clear yet what form those hubs would take). The new bill also recognizes that simply throwing money at research problems isn't always the best way to make progress. Many of the key government-funded innovations over the past few decades, including the internet itself, have come from the legendary Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA uses a unique model for organizing research projects: giving free rein to powerful program directors, pulling in researchers from across different institutions and fields, and focusing on specific goals. The technology directorate of the proposed NSTF would have the ability to organize DARPA-like projects in addition to traditional research efforts. If enacted, the Endless Frontier Act would help revitalize the U.S. economy at the national and regional levels and preserve institutions of higher education. But it has one more important goal: keeping the U.S. ahead of its new rival China in the emerging technology race. The U.S. cannot maintain its technological lead simply by kneecapping China with export restrictions or by putting a halt to Chinese espionage, it also needs to invest vigorously in its own capabilities, just as China has done. Big investments in research were one of the key ways that the U.S. won the original Cold War against the Soviet Union, and this contest will be no different. Many of the areas of research named in the act are either things China has invested aggressively in or things that would help U.S. industry stay ahead of Chinese competition - artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, biotechnology and so on. There are two possible concerns about the plan. First, even with more than $20 billion a year, it isn't enough to restore U.S. technological leadership - at least, not if the Cold War is any guide. Federal research spending has declined from 1.2% of gross domestic product to only 0.8% since the late 1980s, and $20 billion is only 0.1% of GDP. Ideally, the Endless Frontier Act will be only the start. The initial spending, although substantial, will actually be a proof of concept that can be scaled up later once the new directorate is created and researchers learn how to put the new flows of money to productive use. Second, some scientists worry that a greater focus on technology and mission-oriented, DARPA-style research will detract from the NSF's traditional pursuit of basic research. But this probably isn't something worth agonizing over. The Endless Frontier Act would actually boost the budgets of the NSF's existing science directorates, which work on basic research and traditional approaches. Investing in applicable technologies and mission-oriented projects is a complement to traditional basic research, not a substitute. In fact, accidental discoveries made by scientists working on applied technologies can even create new directions for fundamental research. A big push for federal research spending is one of the most obvious things the U.S. government could do to both benefit the U.S. economy and restore U.S. tech dominance. This bipartisan plan is a very encouraging sign that the U.S. isn't content to slip grumpily into decline.

        <h4>Where Is the Inequality Problem?</h4>
        <div>
          Reading Thomas Piketty 's influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings. That is odd, because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book, Angus Deaton's The Great Escape (which I recently reviewed ), that the world is more equal than ever.Which view is right? The answer depends on whether one looks only at countries individually or at the world as a whole.The overarching fact in Deaton's book is that over the last few decades, several billion people in the developing world, particularly in Asia, have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty. The same machine that has increased inequality in rich countries has leveled the playing field globally for billions. Looking from afar, and giving, say, an Indian the same weight as an American or a Frenchman, the last 30 years have been among the greatest in human history for improving the lot of the poor.Piketty's brilliant book documents within-country inequality, with the main focus being on the rich world. Much of the cultural groundswell surrounding his book has come from people who view themselves as middle class within their own countries, but who are upper middle class or even rich by global standards.There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez. But I find their results persuasive, especially given that other authors, using completely different methods, have reached similar conclusions. Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis of the University of Chicago, for example, argue that labor's share of GDP has been declining globally since the 1970's.However, Piketty and Saez do not really offer a model, nor does this new book. And the lack of a model, combined with a focus on the world's upper-middle-class countries, matters a lot when it comes to policy prescriptions. Would Piketty's followers be nearly as enthusiastic about his proposed progressive global wealth tax if it were aimed at correcting the huge disparities between the richest countries and the poorest, instead of between those who are well off by global standards and the ultra-wealthy?Piketty argues that capitalism is unfair. Wasn't colonialism unfair, too? In any event, the idea of a global wealth tax is replete with credibility and enforcement problems, aside from being politically implausible.Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades, he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes. For example, if the main driver is the massive influx of Asian labor into globalized trade markets, the growth model put forth by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow suggests that eventually capital stocks will adjust and the wage rate will rise. Retirements from an aging labor force will eventually drive up wages as well. If , on the other hand, labor's share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation, downward pressures on that share will continue, as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago.Fortunately, there are much better ways to address rich-country inequality while still fostering long-term growth in demand for products from developing countries. For example, a shift to a relatively flat consumption tax (with a large deductible for progressivity) would be a far simpler and more effective way to tax past wealth accumulation, especially if citizens' tax home can be linked to the locale where their income was earned.A progressive consumption tax is relatively efficient and does not distort savings decisions as much as today's income taxes do. Why try to move to an improbable global wealth tax when alternatives are available that are growth friendly, raise significant revenue, and can be made progressive through a very high exemption.In addition to a global wealth tax, Piketty recommends an 80% marginal tax rate on income for the United States. Though I strongly believe that the US needs more progressive taxation, particularly of the top 0.1%, I don't understand why he assumes that an 80% rate would not cause significant distortions, especially as this assumption contradicts a large body of work by the Nobel laureates Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott.There are many practical policies that can be adopted to reduce inequality, in addition to a progressive consumption tax. Focusing on the US, Jeffery Frankel of Harvard University has suggested the elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers, a cut in deductions for high-income workers, and higher inheritance taxes. Universal pre-school education would enhance long-term growth, as would a much greater emphasis on lifetime adult education (my addition), possibly via online courses. Carbon taxes would help mitigate global warming while raising considerable revenues.In accepting Piketty's premise that inequality matters more than growth, one needs to remember that many developing-country citizens rely on rich-country growth to help them escape poverty. The first problem of the twenty-first century remains to help the dire poor in Africa and elsewhere. By all means, the elite 0.1% should pay much more in taxes, but let us not forget that when it comes to reducing global inequality, the capitalist system has had an impressive three decades.Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief economist of the IMF , is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014.

        <h4>My End-to-End Process for Data Science Projects</h4>
        <div>
          Why do I write this story? Simply because not every data science project is successful. For sure, you can Google this topic and you will find thousands of reasons. For me, projects that didn't succeed have been the biggest opportunities to improve my process and my skills. In this story, I will briefly summarize my learnings by providing my current (and still improving) process in a data science project. I do not doubt that this process does not apply to everyone simply because there is not a single definition of a &quot;data science project&quot;. My aim here is to share my experience by summarizing the different steps of a project. It does not guarantee success, but, at least, this process will try to address all pitfalls that you, as a Data Scientist, can prevent. My role is to create pipelines that consume data and provide insight(s) (see my definition of pipeline in my previous story ). This is the process I am using to do so. Scope the solution The first step is to scope the solution. Sometimes it is very hard to find the balance between expectations and pricing. My recommendation is to drive any decisions by looking at the real need. This would allow putting aside &quot;nice to have&quot; s and prioritize &quot;mandatory features&quot;. Start with &quot;why?&quot; (ref: Simon Sinek) To draft the scope of the project, the first step is to work with the client and to understand the pain point and his motivations. In this story, I will use the term client for the person paying for the project. In reality, the client might be a director/VP/CTO of your company. The client is the one that decided to invest in this project. It is mandatory to understand why this person is interested in this project. Maximizing production? Scaling of a process? Avoid failures in his factory? Anything What is the pain point? This is very important for the next step. A good trick is to ask how the client is currently treating his pain point. If there is already a metric capturing the efficiency of the current process. Who will use it? Many times I had the opportunity to draft a scope without even knowing who will use the solution. This is wrong! A project is successful if the solution is used. I have been in projects where the user is not even clearly identified. This is the best way to create something that will never be used. A CEO of a company says: &quot;AI is trendy and cool, we should do something with it&quot;. RUN! Let's take an example. A director/VP wants to use AI to optimize stock management in his factory. Great! Then I started talking about the solution but the future user is not even in the room. We start working on the project and we decided that the algorithm will provide an email every morning with a forecast of demand to help the stock manager to make the best decision. I work hard and I succeed in this task. We even develop the infrastructure to support the algorithm. Everything is done and the CEO is happy! Well, guess what? This forecast is not even the manager's biggest concern. He has a hard time figuring out in real-time where and what items are available in the factory. Too bad, a simple interactive dashboard would have done the job. The forecast is useless without this information. The project is a failure. In another situation, the manager needs a forecast every week and not every day, or the forecast needs to be available in realtime not per day All those situations happen. My best recommendation is to bring the future user as early as you can in the conversation because he is the best person to define the needs What? At this point, what I want is a clear success criterion. Client: &quot;I need the algorithm to predict when my assembly line will fail&quot;. Me: &quot;Ok&quot;, me looking at the operator, &quot;How much in advance do you need this prediction?&quot; (Here, I am trying to define the granularity of the problem.) Operator: &quot;I need the prediction for 2 days in advance, and I need this information in the morning before 7 am&quot;. Me: &quot;Great, but you have to understand that chances are the algorithm will produce false alarms and also miss some failures. Are you comfortable with this? What is the current situation? How much cost failure and how much cost asking the maintenance team to work on a machine if it is not needed? How many machines you can check within a day?&quot; I need all those answers to create a success criterion. Me: &quot;How do you solve this problem right now?&quot;. Operator: &quot;We have 1000 machines and we have at least 1 of them would fail every day. We cannot check them all, so, we prioritize our investigation by checking the one that has not been checked for a long time&quot;. The last information is very important because it tells me where is the bar. If I simulate the current strategy, I can evaluate how much better my solution is. All this information helps me to define a metric with a success criterion. In this type of situation, I rather use a metric like a Hit Rate. The number of true positives within the top N most probable predicted failures. N is the number of interventions the maintenance team can take care of within a day. I rarely communicate metrics like F-Measure or AUC to the client because he cannot use this measurement to decide if the solution is a success or not. At the end of the conversation, we found out that a Hit Rate of 2 would be valuable enough for the solution to be used. Also, thanks to the information I collected, I can price how much money the client is currently wasting and how much money the client can save with a successful solution. Then, I can convert my metric in dollars when I present progress to the client. An important consideration is that my solution will be integrated into an existing system. This system exists for a reason and people are using it. The AI solution will alter this system. This disruption has to be anticipated otherwise the final phase of the project (when people use the solution) may cause unexpected additional costs. This disruption might be so important that the client might finally change his mind and refuse to take the risk of releasing the solution (it happened to me). My recommendation is to introduce this potential disruption in the conversation during the initial scoping of the solution. At the end of the discussion, I ask for a snippet of data, some information about the way we can collect the data, etc I do data analysis (1-2 days) to check if there are no big red flags. Data engineers would also take part in the conversation to draft an architecture. Now, I have the scope, I can move to the next step which is working on the solution. The Proof Of Concept (POC) phase The objective of this phase is to demonstrate that the project is viable and can bring value. To optimize the process in this phase, you have to consider what needs to be constraints. Basically in a POC phase, I cannot constraint the time, the resources, and the accuracy at the same time. Time means the amount of time I can spend on this project. Resources are the number of persons allocated to this project. Accuracy means the accuracy of the model. Theoretically, you can only constraints two of them. In reality, resources are more or less always constrained. Maybe some companies can allocate an &quot;infinite&quot; number of resources on a project. I have never been in such a situation. If you relax accuracy, it corresponds to a &quot;hackathon mode&quot; or &quot;spike&quot;. It is useful when you want to investigate an idea, most probably, for a short time. The most realistic choice is to relax time. Some clients have a hard time working in this mode because they have deadlines to respect and they might have the feeling that the POC will never end. But, the trick is to communicate progress to the client in an efficient way. For that reason, I use the Agile methodology. This paradigm has been invented for software development but I adapt it in the context of a data science project. If you are not familiar with the wording, I invite you to read some articles about Agile. Sprint 1: I work generally in a sprint of 2 or 3 weeks depending on the client. The objective of the first sprint is to establish a baseline. A baseline is declared when the first end-to-end pipeline (from data to metric) delivers a number. In this initial sprint, I choose the simplest path. This is the only thing that matters. Get a number as fast as possible. For instance, if some variables have missing values, the simplest is to remove those variables from the dataset. Or if I have to choose a model, the simplest is a linear regression or a logistic regression because there is no parametrization. No creasy preprocessing, only simple steps. Avoid any type of step that would imply fine-tuning or calibration. No PCA, no standardization, nothing. Basically, in this sprint, I set up the CI/CD, the git repository, I write a parser, and I create the simplest version of the pipeline to end up with a number for the metric. The only thing that I need to pay attention to is the evaluation strategy. It is hard to compare performances between 2 pipelines if you switch between 66% train 33% test procedure to a cross-validation procedure. The evaluation strategy needs to be as close as possible from the way the pipeline will be used. In the above example, I would use a growing window for the training set and a sliding window for the test set. Sprint 2: The second sprint is to productize the baseline. With the help of data engineers and DevOps, we set up the architecture to support the pipeline. Some people prefer to wait until the pipeline reaches the level of accuracy as it is defined in the scope. For me, I try to unblock the other teams as early as I can to produce an MVP as soon as possible. For my sprints, I use standard cycles. A stand up meeting every day to check if there are no blockers. We do planning at the beginning of the sprint and demo at the end. We also do retrospective from time to time. At the end of the sprint, we check if the new version of the pipeline provides better results compared to the baseline. If yes, it corresponds to the new baseline for the next sprint. I track this information over sprints and I include it in the demo. I show the plot above to the client during the demo. He can decide 1) to continue for another sprint, 2) to declare that we reach the objectives or 3) to drop the project because the current solution is too far from the expectations and it would take a prohibitive amount of time to finish. This early stoping is beneficial for everyone. For the client, he is not wasting money on a project that might be too expensive and for the team to be reallocated to another project with a higher probability of success. The demo is also the opportunity to validate new assumptions. During each iteration, I increase the complexity of the pipeline. For instance, I gather external data to augment the dataset, I improve the preprocessing, add more features, use a different algorithm, etc The danger here is to over-engineer the pipeline. For instance, I don't try to draft a new deep learning architecture at the second iteration or I don't add crazy complex features to nail one or two outliers that would not affect the metric drastically. To identify what can be the most impactful alteration of the pipeline, I often look at instances that have the largest error to try to find an explanation and derive a new cleaning strategy and/or new features. I order those alterations by the amount of work and start with the simplest. A note about CI/CD and notebook: A measurement of the metric has to be reproducible. So I disregard any data point that has not been produced by the CI/CD pipeline. If the result has been obtained in a Jupyter notebook, I have to convince myself that it can be reproduced on another machine. Notebooks are cool for data analysis but they require strong discipline to make sure the results are reproducible. I know I am not capable of such a thing. For that reason, I only trust numbers from the CI/CD. I have been in a situation where I claimed to the client that we meet the expectation and finally, I was not able to reproduce the results. It is very frustrating and costly for everyone I wish you never have to live in this situation. Productization I strongly recommend you have a look at the article &quot; Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems &quot;. The machine learning code is a small piece of the entire solution. It is important to have a clear picture of the additional steps needed for productization. productization requires the support of data engineers and DevOps. Hopefully, the POC is done and we met the success criterion. Good!! Now we need to productize the pipeline. There are two main ways to proceed: Hands-off . The results of the POC are translated into specifications. A team of software developers take over, rewrite the entire code, and productize the pipeline. Push to prod . My code is reused &quot;as is&quot; and with the help of data engineers and DevOps, we build an infrastructure around it. Both approaches have pros and cons. The hands-off approach will make sure that the solution is more stable. Because a data scientist is not always an experimented developer (no offense here), productization of the code is often in the hand of other people. It is often the case in a large company. A detail, in this situation, the ownership of the code does not belong to the data scientist anymore. So fixing bugs is done by the software development team. The second approach is to ask the data scientist to wrap his code into a library and it will be used in another system. For instance, in a lambda function in the cloud. This approach is faster since we avoid rewriting code. The code is &quot;cleaned&quot; and the debts are paid. If you follow my recommendations in my previous story , this step can be done efficiently. Finally, the owner of the code remains the data scientist and I am in charge of fixing bugs. This way is often chosen in small companies and startups where a limited number of people can work on each project. I prefer to use the second option. I will explain my reason with more detail in the next section. Briefly, when using the first approach, if I want to release improvements of the solution or to add some features, I would have to work on my code base, rewrite specifications, wait for the developer team to update the solution, etc This can take months. A fast cycle would imply to minimize hands-off. Maintaining and improving the pipeline Ok, now my pipeline is in production. However, it is important to create a process to capture the feedback of the operator to continuously improve the solution. For instance, The operator is using the product daily but he proposed some improvements for the algorithm. For instance, instead of predicting if a failure would occur, he prefers to have a score or a probability of failure. To derive a score from the prediction, it would require a minor change in the pipeline. Just returning the probability instead of the predicted class. What I try to do is to set up a feedback process as soon as the first version of the pipeline is accessible (sprint 2-3). This feedback loop would also help me to adjust over the sprints but when the product is released, this continuous improvement remains. To have a good interaction with the user, I want improvement to be released as fast as possible. For that reason, I avoid the hands-off strategy to do the improvement myself and get feedback faster. The feedback loop is also important to capture the decisions made by the operator. When decisions don't match the prediction of the pipelines, it means we can improve the pipeline by incorporating the &quot;reasons&quot; the operator took his decision. Over time, the role of the operator will change and get simpler. One consequence is the ability to scale his capabilities. Ultimately, a predictive pipeline can become a prescriptive pipeline. Then, the prediction is not interpreted by the operator anymore and directly connected to take action. This introduces my last point: Company reorganization It is important to understand that introducing an AI solution in a company, will disrupt the usual way the employee would work. Sometimes, the employees' role changes and additional skills might be needed. For example, if you introduce a chatbot to help the customer support team, this team might be reduced or reallocated to other tasks. The solution might also cause some business reorientation in the client company. I have seen some companies changing their strategy from selling products to selling services because of the new solution. This is often not anticipated by the client. Sometimes, it can cause the project to stop for a while. It happened to me that the company would have been so much affected by the algorithm that the reorganization and the integration of the solution in their system would require much more investment. They finally decided not to use it. I try to introduce this subject very early in the process to make sure the client would anticipate the situation. Please feel free to connect.

        <h4>VW Is Said to Weigh Listing of Porsche Sports-Car Division</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG is considering a separate listing of its Porsche sports-car unit in a deal that could boost its valuation and bring in a significant amount of cash, according to people familiar with the matter.The world's second-largest carmaker is speaking with advisers to study the merits of a potential initial public offering or spinoff of Porsche, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. VW could use any proceeds from a listing for acquisitions or technology investments, according to the people.Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess sounded the alarm in an interview with Bloomberg News last month about how Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle companies are cashing in on market optimism about their growth prospects. Investors have taken a dimmer view of VW and other incumbents, who will need to spend tens of billions to develop EVs while restructuring operations that revolve around combustion engines.VW's preferred shares rose as much as 6% in Frankfurt trading. At about $757 billion, Tesla's market value is roughly seven times higher than VW's 90 billion euros ($109 billion).''A Volkswagen IPO of its Porsche brand would be a bold solution to generating much-needed shareholder value,'' Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. Porsche's plan to be almost all-electric by 2030, with the exception of the 911 model, could ''attract Tesla-like multiples while generating a Ferrari-like Ebitda margin.''Dean said his analysis indicates that Porsche has a value of 110 billion euros, more than its parent.Listing TimetableA Porsche listing could take place next year, though no firm timetable has been decided, the people said. VW plans to keep a majority stake if it pursues an IPO of the business, according to the people.Deliberations are ongoing, and there's no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for VW declined to comment. Manager Magazin reported earlier Thursday that VW is weighing a listing of Porsche, citing unidentified people.VW so far has little to show for the asset review it started in 2016, in the wake of its diesel-emissions scandal, to explore options for niche brands and non-core operations. The company pushed through a downsized IPO of its trucks unit Traton SE in 2019 after internal wrangling almost derailed the project.Labor leaders and the Porsche and Piech families who own VW resisted efforts in 2017 to sell Ducati in 2017, and similar opposition emerged late last year when reports speculated the company might offload the motorcycle unit. While VW folded Ducati, Lamborghini and Italdesign into a structure that made it somewhat easier to make ownership changes, the company announced a month later that it would keep them.Valuation FrustrationValuation has been a vexing issue for Diess, 62, who set a goal in 2019 to make VW worth 200 billion euros. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company has ample cash to afford a massive budget to develop EVs and invest in the software the CEO sees as critical to the industry's future.VW already has placed bets on promising startups including battery companies NorthVolt AB and QuantumScape Corp. It also invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, Ford Motor Co.'s autonomous-car development partner, in 2019.After Diess agitated late last year for a more comprehensive overhaul of VW and clashed with key stakeholders, the supervisory board defused the conflict by throwing its full support behind the CEO and naming several of his allies to key management posts. The company said it intended to hammer out a plan with unions by the end of this quarter to reduce fixed costs 5% by 2023 and lower material costs by 7% in the next two years.Dramatic HistoryA Porsche listing or IPO would partially reverse an acquisition concluded in 2012, when Volkswagen bought the remaining 50.1% stake in Porsche's automotive business for 4.46 billion euros. That step ended a seven-year takeover saga that divided two of the most powerful families in Germany.The two brands are historically linked through Ferdinand Porsche, the creator of the original VW Beetle. His descendants, who controlled the sports-, racked up more than 10 billion euros of debt in an unsuccessful attempt to take over Europe's largest carmaker.The two companies agreed to combine in 2009. The deal made the Porsche-Piech clan, which included the late former VW CEO Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's largest shareholders.The operating Porsche unit for which VW is considering a listing or IPO is separate from Porsche Automobile Holding SE, a holding company that has 53.3% of VW's ordinary shares.(Updates with analyst's comment in the fifth paragraph.)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Samsung Details Plans for $17 Billion Chip Facility in U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. revealed additional details about its plans to build a cutting-edge semiconductor facility in the U.S. in a filing with the Texas government, making the disclosure asthe Biden administration vows to make the security of the U.S. chip supply a national priority.The South Korean company plans to invest about $17 billion in its Project Silicon Silver and create about 1,800 jobs over the first ten years, according to an economic impact study prepared by a local consultant. Some $5.1 billion would go into buildings and property improvements, while $9.9 billion would be spent on machinery and equipment.The filing with the Texas comptroller warned the chips project is ''highly competitive.'' Samsung is evaluating alternatives sites in Arizona and New York, as well as in Korea.''Because of its strong ties to the local community and the successful past 25 years of manufacturing in Texas, Samsung Austin Semiconductor would like to continue to invest in the city and the state,'' the study said.Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Core of U.S.-China Policy (1)In their first weeks in office, Joe Biden's administration has emphasized the importance of advanced technologies, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks. The president has ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths.Bloomberg News first reported in January that Samsung was considering building an advanced chipmaking plant in the U.S., in hopes of winning more American clients and narrowing the gap with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company was in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Details of Samsung's discussions with local governments have since leaked out in filings and other revelations. The economic impact study was prepared by Impact DataSource LLC, an Austin, Texas-based economic consulting, research and analysis firm.The report shows Samsung's Project Silicon Silver would add approximately 7 million square feet of new space to the Austin campus, where the company has had operations for decades. It estimates that 542 new workers would move to the city, contributing to an addition of 1,626 new residents.Property tax abatements would total about $1.5 billion over 20 years at the city and county levels, while direct and indirect economic output would be about $8.6 billion and salaries would total $7.3 billion.A January filing detailed the likely timeline for the project. If Samsung chooses Austin, it would break ground in the second quarter of 2021 with the expectation that production would be up and running by the fourth quarter of 2023, it said.Separately, Samsung's current foundry plant in Austin hasn't resumed operations since Feb. 16 after it was ordered to halt operations by Austin Energy due to blackouts in the region. Power and water are back but it will take more time to fully restart operations, officials said.(Updates with timeline for project in penultimate paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>SoftBank Founder Tells Wall Street He's Eager to Keep Investing</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp., facing skepticism of its investment strategy, conveyed a message to Wall Street on Monday: Now is the time to invest. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder and chief executive officer, told a roomful of fund managers and financial institutions at a private meeting in New York that recent market declines present an opportunity to invest in companies at discounted valuations, according to people who attended. He also argued that SoftBank is well-positioned to pick the winners. Son highlighted Arm Ltd., whose technology is the basis of most of the world's smartphone processors, as an effective bet for SoftBank, despite intensifying scrutiny about the British company's losses. For the last month, SoftBank has been trying to manage a campaign from an activist investor. Elliott Management Corp., the New York-based investment firm, amassed a stake in SoftBank worth nearly $3 billion and outlined recommendations that it says would lift the company's share price. They include increasing oversight of SoftBank's Vision Fund, selling stock holdings and using the proceeds to buy back SoftBank shares. Monday's event, hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. at the Lotte New York Palace hotel, gave investors a venue to pose questions to Son, the 62-year-old Japanese billionaire. Attendees were asked to email their queries to a Goldman Sachs moderator, who filtered and selected which ones to ask, according to attendees, who requested anonymity because the meeting was private. A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Son pledged to start &quot;listening more&quot; to independent directors and shareholders. He said as the company's largest shareholder, nobody wants to see the stock price rise as much as he does. The company's market value is about $100 billion, less than half of what SoftBank has said it should be worth. SoftBank plans to forge ahead with a scaled-down Vision Fund II, Son reiterated at the meeting. He expects 2020 and 2021 to be the &quot;best vintage&quot; for the Vision Fund, according to one of the people in the room. He predicted that about 15% of Vision Fund companies would go bust, while another 15% would account for 90% of profits. Son expressed regret about overpaying for stock in WeWork, the beleaguered co-working company. But he advised the room to &quot;expect great things&quot; from WeWork parent We Co. in the next one to three years. Son also said SoftBank would seek to stop investing in companies that compete with one another, as it has done in ride hailing, food delivery and other industries. Despite these setbacks, Son said he remains convinced in his investment thesis that artificial intelligence will disrupt all industries. He said he plans to continue backing financial, medical and transportation companies, among those in other industries, that are driving what he describes as an &quot;information revolution.&quot; --With assistance from Sarah McBride.

        <h4>Disparate impacts in AI implementations</h4>
        <div>
          Every day, more and more decisions are made across the enterprise, and many of these decisions are made by algorithms within AI systems. Humans can unconsciously bring biases into their decision-making, and we must ensure that these are not reflected or further emphasized in our AI decision-making process. AI has the potential to help reduce unfair biases and help us ensure responsibility in our decision making to avoid disparate impacts.Biases can be both intentional and unintentional, so we need to understand where they may pop up. One example of unintentional bias is commonly shown through disparate impact (also known as indirect discrimination).Disparate impact is when policies, rules, and outcomes disproportionately impact a specific group of individuals, though there are no underlying intentions to do so. Unintentional bias is particularly important to address as it can be quite harmful to different groups of people in our society.Unintentional proxy discriminationAn example where there has been a long history of bias is within the financial services industry, specifically within the determination of creditworthiness. It is essential for financial institutions to determine consumer risk when pricing their financial service, many times looking deep into their customers' history.Many countries and jurisdictions have laws that prevent financial institutions from basing their pricing policies on certain characteristics (race, gender, age, marital status, etc.). While the algorithm might not be using a gender variable directly in its decision-making process, it can still use gender proxies.A proxy for gender could be found in a person's purchasing history, for example, the type of deodorant or razors purchased. Unintentional proxy discrimination should be monitored in these systems as well.AI has the potential to help us to detect and correct these biases. Disparate impact can be addressed through disparate impact assessments and fairness assessments. Fairness can be challenging to define, so it is important to decide on different fairness metrics and standards for each AI project implemented.Regulatory adherenceAddressing disparate impact and fairness is not only the right thing to do but is also essential in terms of regulatory adherence. Having a system in place that helps ensure you meet regulatory requirements can help with both reputational and business risks in the short and long term.It is essential to highlight the principal role of human involvement in the AI process. We are in a unique position to understand the nuances of the outcomes, the data collection process, and other steps in the AI model process. By working in tandem with the algorithms, there is a lower chance of bias making it through the system.Tools &amp; impact assessmentsThere are several top of the line open-source libraries that help assess and evaluate the presence and level of different biases in your models. At 2021.AI, we've implemented several of the best open source libraries into our Grace AI platform.We want our clients to have options and pick the best one for what they are looking for. We think you should have access to state-of-the-art tools that are benchmarks in the AI ecosystem. A sample of the libraries we work with on the Grace AI platform include:Impact Assessments are one way we, at 2021.AI, are introducing more human oversight into the AI model process. They can help structure a process in which the expectations, implications, and potential outcomes are weighed during the development and deployment of an AI model.Asking a different set of questions depending on the AI model and data used can ensure a more transparent process and ensure that the project leaders are assessing and checking in at each stage of the model development and deployment process.Combining the fairness tools with Impact Assessments can give a transparent overview of the AI models and their outcomes. Through informative questions and data pulled directly from the model outcomes, answers can be scaled and weighted to produce a multi-layered score.This combination can help make sure that a model's goals line up with the outcome of the model. Measuring and analyzing the bias in models leads to greater accountability, which is a key element in more responsible decision making.Being able to qualify and understand the presence of bias in your models and outcomes is the first step to reducing indirect discrimination. This removes one of the barriers to accountability and scrutiny of algorithms that can be difficult to carry out when working with opaque, ''black box'' style tools.Not only is it important to meet regulatory requirements, but having an unbiased and fair model can be better for business and ensure that you are optimizing your products more efficiently.Dette indlæg blev oprindeligt bragt på 2021.AI's blog.

        <h4>Microsoft DoWhy is an Open Source Framework for Causal Reasoning</h4>
        <div>
            The framework explores causal relationships between different variables. The human mind has a remarkable ability to associate causes with a specific event.From the outcome of an election to an object dropping on the floor, we are constantly associating chains of events that cause a specific effect. Neuropsychology refers to this cognitive ability as causal reasoning. Computer science and economics study a specific form of causal reasoning known as causal inference which focuses on exploring relationships between two observed variables. Over the years, machine learning has produced many methods for causal inference but they remain mostly difficult to use in mainstream applications. Last year, Microsoft Research open sourced DoWhy , a framework for causal thinking and analysis which since then has seen many interesting contributions. The challenge with causal inference is not that is a new discipline, quite the opposite, but that the current methods represent a very small and simplistic version of causal reasoning. Most models that try to connect causes such as linear regression rely on empirical analysis that makes some assumption about the data. Pure causal inference relies on counterfactual analysis which is a closer representation to how humans make decisions. Imagine a scenario in which you are traveling with your families for vacations to an unknown destination. Before and after the vacation you are wrestling with a few counterfactual questions: Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Answering these questions is the focus of causal inference. Unlike supervised learning, causal inference depends on estimation of unobserved quantities. This if often known as the &quot;fundamental problem&quot; of causal inference which implies that a model never has a purely objective evaluation through a held-out test set. In our vacation example, you can either observe the effects on going on vacation or not going on vacations but never both. This challenge forces causal inference to make critical assumptions about the data generation process. Traditional machine learning frameworks for causal inference try to take shortcuts around the &quot;fundamental problem&quot; resulting on a very frustrating experience for data scientists and developers. Introducing DoWhy Microsoft's DoWhy is a Python-based library for causal inference and analysis that attempts to streamline the adoption of causal reasoning in machine learning applications. Inspired by Judea Pearl's do-calculus for causal inference, DoWhy combines several causal inference methods under a simple programming model that removes many of the complexities of traditional approaches. Compared to its predecessors, DoWhy makes three key contributions to the implementation of causal inference models. Provides a principled way of modeling a given problem as a causal graph so that all assumptions explicit. Provides a unified interface for many popular causal inference methods, combining the two major frameworks of graphical models and potential outcomes. Automatically tests for the validity of assumptions if possible and assesses robustness of the estimate to violations. Conceptually, DoWhy was created following two guiding principles: asking causal assumptions explicit and testing robustness of the estimates to violations of those assumptions. In other words, DoWhy separates the identification of a causal effect from the estimation of its relevance which enables the inference of very sophisticated causal relationships. To accomplish its goal, DoWhy models any causal inference problem in a workflow with four fundamental steps: model, identify, estimate and refute. Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Model: DoWhy models each problem using a graph of causal relationships. The current version of DoWhy supports two formats for graph input: gml (preferred) and dot . The graph might include prior knowledge of the causal relationships in the variables but DoWhy does not make any immediate assumptions. Identify: Using the input graph, DoWhy finds all possible ways of identifying a desired causal effect based on the graphical model. It uses graph-based criteria and do-calculus to find potential ways find expressions that can identify the causal effect Estimate: DoWhy estimates the causal effect using statistical methods such as matching or instrumental variables. The current version of DoWhy supports estimation methods based such as propensity-based-stratification or propensity-score-matching that focus on estimating the treatment assignment as well as regression techniques that focus on estimating the response surface. Verify: Finally, DoWhy uses different robustness methods to verify the validity of the causal effect. Using DoWhy Developers can start using DoWhy by installing the Python module using the following command: python setup.py install Like any other machine learning program, the first step of a DoWhy application is to load the dataset. In this example, imagine that we are trying to infer the correlation between different medical treatments and outcomes represented by the following dataset. Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez DoWhy relies on pandas dataframes to capture the input data: rvar = 1 if np.random.uniform() &amp;gt,0.5 else 0 data_dict = dowhy.datasets.xy_dataset(10000, effect=rvar, sd_error=0.2) df = data_dict['df'] print(df[[&quot;Treatment&quot;, &quot;Outcome&quot;, &quot;w0&quot;]].head()) At this point, we simply need about four steps to infer causal relationships between the variables. The four steps correspond to the four operations of DoWhy: model, estimate, infer and refute. We can start by modeling the problem as a causal graph: model= CausalModel( data=df, treatment=data_dict[&quot;treatment_name&quot;], outcome=data_dict[&quot;outcome_name&quot;], common_causes=data_dict[&quot;common_causes_names&quot;], instruments=data_dict[&quot;instrument_names&quot;]) model.view_model(layout=&quot;dot&quot;) from IPython.display import Image, display display(Image(filename=&quot;causal_model.png&quot;)) Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez The next step is to identify the causal relationships in the graph: identified_estimand = model.identify_effect() Now we can estimate the causal effect and determine if the estimation is correct. This example uses linear regression for simplicity: estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=&quot;backdoor.linear_regression&quot;) # Plot Slope of line between treamtent and outcome =causal effect dowhy.plotter.plot_causal_effect(estimate, df[data_dict[&quot;treatment_name&quot;]], df[data_dict[&quot;outcome_name&quot;]]) Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Finally, we can use different technique to refute the causal estimator: res_random=model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate, method_name=&quot;random_common_cause&quot;) DoWhy is a very simple and useful framework to implement causal inference models. The current version can be used as a standalone library or integrated into popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The combination of multiple causal inference methods under a single framework and the four-step simple programming model makes DoWhy incredibly simple to use for data scientist tackling causal inference problems.

        <h4>Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut: A machine learning model to sell my car</h4>
        <div>
          There are pages dedicated to answering this question, but I suspected a bias toward selling it too cheap to resellers, so I wanted to do my own research. As I intended to sell my car on a large Danish car site called, www.bilbasen.dk I used the data on this site as a reference for my research. All the code and data from the research can be found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/tjansson60/car_sale_modelGetting the data for the analysisTo get data for the analysis I wrote a simple scraper that got basic data from 490 Skoda Fabia's currently on sale on bilbasen.dk, the script can be seen here and should be fairly easy to hack for another model:scrape_bilbasen.pyThe only manual part is to set up the trim packages filters. For the 490 cars, it took around 10 minutes to run. The scraped data has the following form:Analysing data from the 490 carsAfter having downloaded the data analyzed the data set in the following Jupiter notebook:data_analysis.ipynbA key learning from the analysis was that it seem that the major feature in determining the price would be the model year and odometer (total distance traveled by the car). The following plots sums this up:This was confirmed by inspecting the correlation between all variables. The price is strongly correlated with the model year and the horsepowers of the car and heavily anticorrelated with the odometer. It can also be seen that manual gears are anticorrelated with the price, so my automatic gear car should benefit from this:I had expected the region to play a role, but I found no real correlation between the price and the region, which in hindsight makes sense as the internet removes this bias:Machine learning model - Random Forest RegressorI could very well just have used the cross-plots and found a reasonable price, but this would not be using a sledgehammer to crack the nut, so instead, I fitted a random forest regressor to make a machine learning model predict the correct price based on the data I had. In the Jupiter notebook:predictive_price_model.ipynbI trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict the selling price of my car using the 490 cars as input. The median absolute error of model is 4882 DKK, which is not bad considering cars price ranged from 4999 to 207800 DKK with a mean price of 87660 DKK:One of the benefits of using a random forest regressor is that it is quite easy to understand the results. From the model, it is possible to extract the feature importance and hence understand what is the most defining factors in the model. In this case, and a bit to my surprise, the model year was even more important than the odometer.Model explainer and test caseUsing a tool as lime or shap it is also rather easy to understand how the model makes a prediction. In the following example, I have taken a known example from the test part of my data (which has not been used in the training of the model). The estimate is only 7000 DKK from the actual listed price which I consider fairly good, but more importantly, using lime I can understand why this is the case:As it can be seen the largest contributor to this price is that the car is fairly new, but also that it has driven less than 42000 KM. Apparently, the car being sold from the North of Zealand does take the price estimate down by 2129 DKK, but it is a minor effect.What is my car worth?Formatting my car in the parameters of my model it is possible to ask the model what the price estimate should be for my car and why which factors contributed to this:So according to the model, I should sell my car for 180600 DKK to adhere to the model.Model limitations and follow upI only had a limited amount of metadata from the scraping to train my model and in the price is also influenced by the following factors:Is it a dealer sale or a private sale?What kind of warrenty is available?How many cylinders does the engine have?Using the model output as a starting point I decided to set the price at 189.900 DKK as I had extended the factory warranty by 3 years in the original purchase. This is not something my model accounted for and I knew this would be a strong selling point compared to the dealership sales which usually have some sort of extended warranty.After a week or so I sold the car for 192.000 DKK as it turned out that the engine having 4 cylinders was worth extra to the final buyer that entered a small bidding war. The newer 2018 Skoda Fabia Combi 1.0 TSI engine is only 3 cylinders, so this increased the value of my older car.ConclusionThe model gave a good indication of the selling price of my car, but factors unknown to me turned out to make my car even more worth than I anticipated. An added bonus of this whole exercise was that it was fairly easy for me to reject buyers trying to low-ball the price. As it turned out these people seldom had done the same amount of research when I asked them.

        <h4>Døden dør i 2045</h4>
        <div>
          Forskere vil afskaffe døden, men uden døden bliver livet et rum uden nåde, skriver Thomas Bjerg MikkelsenDøden skal dø. Det er Aubrey de Greys kontroversielle budskab på baggrund af hans forskning som biomedicinsk gerontolog på SENS Foundation.Budskabet bakkes op af Ray Kurzweil, der - hvis man skal tro Bill Gates - er en af de førende personer i verden, når det gælder om at forudsige udviklingen inden for kunstig intelligens.Kurzweil er overbevist om, at forskerne i løbet af en kort årrække - måske allerede i 2023 - vil være i stand til at bygge en super-super-computer, som kan overtrumfe mennesket i alle former for tankevirksomhed og kreativitet. Altså ikke kun i forhold til matematik, men også på alle andre felter.Når super-super-computeren er en realitet, vil det snart - og dvs. senest i 2045 - blive muligt at genskrive vores genetiske kode og dermed udsætte eller ligefrem vende aldringsprocessen, så vi kan leve længere - og til sidst endda evigt.På SENS Foundation beklager Grey og hans forskerkollegaer sig over manglende støtte. De kan ikke forstå, at opbakningen til sådan forskning ikke er større, når man tager gevinsten i betragtning.Alderdommen er jo en fjende, der gør os svag og til sidst slår os ihjel.Måske er svaret helt simpelt, at udsigten til at skulle leve evigt på denne jord ikke er så tillokkende endda.Thomas Bjerg Mikkelsen, generalsekretær i Indre Mission..

        <h4>Blogindlæg: Udpluk fra en god bog om at genopfinde samfundet</h4>
        <div>
          Men det gør nu ikke noget. Grunden er nemlig at vi skal lave et spændende projekt om entreprenørskab. Mere kan jeg egentlig ikke sige, da jeg har lovet ikke at tale om det.Men projektet har betydet at vi må købe nye bøger ind til Tårnet. Og som nogle af jer måske ved, så er jeg meget glad for nye bøger.Og selv føler jeg, at når man har at gøre med projekter som KRÆVER at man skal købe nye, spændende bøger, for at løse opgaven, så har man fat i det rigtige projekt at bruge sin tid på.En tid der også kræver lidt i sin 4 dage lange sommerferie. Hvor der så nu læses i sofaen i familiesommerhuset på Bornholm.Blandt andet i den nye bog af Charles Handy. Handy er for mange en af de mest betydningsfulde management writere, på linje med Peter Drucker, Warren Bennis, CK Prahalad og Clayton Christensen. Det er Handy der er forfatter til bøgerne -The Empty Raincoat-, -Understanding Organizations- og -Gods of Management-. Han er tidligere leder i Shell, økonom og i dag professor ved London Business School.Ja, jeg burde egentlig ikke skrive den her blog. Jeg burde arbejde på OPGAVEN. Men nogle gange har man jo brug for en pause. Og den vil jeg bruge på at lave en lynanmeldelse af Handys nye bog, -The Second Curve   Thoughts on Reinventing Society-.Det er en god bog.I stedet for at trætte med selvfede anmelder-tanker, vil jeg blot skrive udpluk fra bogen. Så kan du selv bedømme om du er enig med Charles Handy og måske endda købe bogen for at læse mere om tankerne bag:- - -I realised that much of my life [] was governed by the [] principle of -If it works don-t fix it.- Exhortations that it won-t work like that much longer, or could work better, fall on deaf ears. The status quo, people kept telling me, has to be better than the unknown. If there has to be change it should be -better than yesterday-, not different. But society is not working as it should. Living is getting harder, not easier, for most.[] As Tancredi famously told his uncle the Prince in Lampedusa-s novel -The Leopard-, -For things to to remain the same, things will have to change.-Already, as I see it, too much of all that is new favours the few and not the many. Society is out of balance.Looking back now, after eighty decades of life, I wonder how it was that, for the first three decades at least, I seldom questioned the way things worked, or were supposed to work, in Britain and in much of the rest of the world. I assumed that because things had always been that way that was the way they were meant to be, that those in authority knew what they were doing and were well advised. I know better now.The pace of change in a democracy is glacial, to be measured in generations not years. Government may often know what they should do, but not how to get re-elected after doing it.My hope is that the book will kindle [the next generation's] curiosity, provoke and stir their imagination, and encourage discussion among friends and colleagues. It was John Maynard Keynes who said, -I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.-Second Curve thinking does not come easily. It requires imagination, intuition and instinct more than rational analysis.Might it be wiser to aim to grow better without growing bigger?Has money become too powerful? If Facebook can rustle up 19 billion dollars from its own resources to buy up a possible competitor, if Google can use its wealth to corner all the artificial intelligence expertise around, are we seeing the need for a modern trust-busting Teddy Roosevelt?One of our faults is that we are too modest, too willing to believe that those in power know best.Researchers in Oxford University suggest that 47 per cent of today-s jobs will be replaced by computers within the next two decades.Walter Mischel, a leading expert on self-control, devised the Marshmellow Test almost 50 years ago. In an empty room he presented young children with a choice: take one marshmellow now or wait a while and have two. It was a test of deferred gratification. After observing the later lives of the children he was convinced that deferred gratification was crucial to a successful life, to better social functioning and to greater sense of self-worth. If he is right then the world of instant constant communication is endangering the successful futures of our young.Markets are useful, but not for everything. Nor do they always work as they should.It would be [] better if [one] compared outcomes not just inputs, since it is the relation between the two that really matters. That was the flaw in [the Soviet] system. You can have a very cheap process producing a very bad product, as happened all too often in the Soviet regimes and still does in our own public sector. A proper market with measured outcomes as well as costs would signal that.A hospital might best be judged on the health of its surrounding population, or at least the continuing life of its patients. A school ideally needs to look at the progress of its students 20 years on. Since such measures of success are both difficult and impractical these organisations use substitute measures   the reoffending rate, the recovery time, the examination results, even though there is often no direct connection with the true longer-term purpose.Intermediate measures fall foul of the MacNamara fallacy, as expressed by the US Secretary of Defence Robert MacNamara during the Vietnam War. It goes like this: The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can-t be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can-t be measured easily really isn-t important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can-t be easily measured really doesn-t exist. This is suicide.Robert Kennedy once said, GDP -measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country: it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile-.Better not bigger. I should have realised, because most of the organisations that I have found it most interesting to work with down the years have been ones where it made no sense to grow any bigger.In America the government once split up AT&amp;T. Why not the new giants?The individual pursuit of more money is a particular snare, because there is no obvious end to it. There will always be someone with more to act as a comparison and a challenge. It is one of the paradoxes of growth that it can end up as a recipe for perpetual dissatisfaction.Companies are not, as some assume, the vassals of their shareholders. A company is a legal person, in every country. The shareholders do not own the business, just the shares. There is a difference. The formal rights of those shareholders only extend to the appointment of a board, and to the remaining assets of the business on its break-up after all other claimants have been paid. The responsibilities of the directors are to the company as a whole, not to the shareholders alone. It was a widespread misinterpretation of company law that gave rise to the elevation of shareholder value as the prime purpose of the company, to short-term thinking and the splurge of bonuses tied to share performance.It has taken 40 years for people to begin to see that Milton Friedman-s idea was not working. Society has not benefited, indeed it almost collapsed in 2008.The distinguished academic Roger Martin has calculated that, overall, company profit were lower in the 40 years after 1970 than they were in the 40 years before, when managers were paid normal salaries to do their job. If we seem to be living better lives it is mainly because there are now two earners in each family where one used to suffice, and those two are working harder and longer than ever before.We have moved from value creation to value extraction.It would be interesting to consider the implications that would follow if we thought of a business as a community rather than a property.To get [businesses as well as other organisations] thinking, all they need to do is to look at some recent findings on the levels of engagement by the workforce in large organisations. The evidence is disturbing: 80 per cent of them say they are not really engaged with the work of the organisation.Michael Maccoby, a psychoanalyst and renowned leadership authority, has described how the modern dual-career or single-parent families, with children in day care from their early years, have created young adults with more interactive social character and peer group than their parents, while their confident access to every kind of information makes them more ready to challenge authority, to be free agents in charge of their own lives.[There is a] difference between efficiency and effectiveness. They should be the same but, in practice, they work differently. Efficiency starts from the input end while effectiveness works back from the end results. As Peter Drucker also said, -There is nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency something that should not be done at all.- Or the opposite, I would add, not doing what should be done because it would cost more, and therefore would appear to be less efficient. Required to increase efficiency, the prison service in Britain was asked to cut costs. They therefore sliced off what they saw as non-essential activities in order to keep security at the necessary level. The problem, as the journalist and blogger Simon Caulkin pointed out, was that these non-essentials included such things as education and gardening which had proved to be the most effective ways of preventing reoffending after leaving prison. In other words, the efficiency savings resulted in more returning prisoners, thus increasing the cost in the long run. Had they started at the other end, with the evidence of the relative longer-term effectiveness of different aspects of the prison regime, they might have decided differently.Leadership [] means knowing your followers.[In Europe by 2050] there are only two workers for every pensioner and those pensioners live until they are nearly 90.Recent surveys reveal that the average Briton would like to retire at 63, go to live in a bungalow near the sea, 11 miles from their nearest offspring, and live for a further 25 years. They estimate that they would need a pension of £23,457 per annum []. The evidence to date suggests that this is optimistic. To achieve such a pension they would have to squirrel away £10,425 a year for 45 years. On average the survey showed the only contributed £2,671 last year, enough for just five years at their wished-for standard of living.Fundamentally, most countries need a complete rethink of their approach to lifetime financial planning now that life goes on so much longer.The problem with the self-responsible society, the one we are slowly becoming, is that we have to learn how to educate ourselves in areas that we did not need to worry about before, because someone else was taking care of them. Financial literacy, understanding how the money world works, is one of those areas and it does not come easy.This is perhaps the most urgent problem facing us today, to restore a proper justice to the creation and distribution of wealth. Wealth has to be spread around more widely without destroying the motivation to create it in the first place.We could always call their bluff, the bluff of those who assert that high rewards are needed to retain their talent. Many would be happy to work for less if that became the norm. If they didn-t, there must be others equally talented who would. The pool of potential senior executives is neither as small nor as exclusive as those inside it consider it to be.Pre-distribution, the economist call it   making the system fairer to begin with, rather than compensating for its deficiencies after the fact   an ugly word for an important point.Something is wrong if you can make more money while you are asleep [waiting for house prices to go up] than if you go out to work.Perhaps a special fund should be created, possibly paid for by the tax on the sale of one-s home, which could be used to allow all work-based education to be tax-deductible and to pay a subsistence wage to learners.Schools, colleges, banks and venture capitalists, businesses and government agencies need to combine to pump-start a new enterprise-led revolution.[I have an] optimistic belief in humanity that there exists in each of us the seed of possibility. This is our -golden seed- which, if we only knew what it was, and if it were to be fertilised, watered and cared for, might lead to personal fulfilment. The best gift that you can give anyone, I maintain, is to help them to find and grow their golden seed.In 1983 Howard Gardner of Harvard University revolutionised much of our thinking on intelligence with his theory of multiple intelligences. [] Gardner [] identified seven types of intelligence:Linguistic intelligenceLogical-mathematical intelligenceMusical intelligenceSpatial intelligenceBodily-kinaesthetic intelligenceIntrapersonal intelligenceInterpersonal intelligence[] The problem is that formal education systems focus on the first two, linguistic and logical-mathematical, and largely ignore others.Ideally we shouldaim for an individual curriculum, one tailored to the needs of each child, rather than a national curriculum that seeks to make every child the same.In our study of the Alchemists [entrepreneurs] it was noteworthy that most of them were second or third children, often less strictly disciplined, with less expected of them initially, more free therefore to be different.The truth is that the nurturing of the golden seed is best done by a mentor.One study that my wife and I did was entitled -Reinvented Lives: Women at Sixty-. In this book we interviewed 28 women who, in their sixties, reinvented themselves to live a new life, often realising an ambition that had been delayed while they brought up a family, but often discovering talents in themselves that they had not realised that they had. It is never too late. One of them became ordained as a priest, another fulfilled a long ambition to work at the South Pole after a life of writing children-s books and raising her family. A third wanted to help out her daughter and found herself running a café in a seaside town and being rather good at it. It is never too late to dig up your seed and start a new curve in life.True learning, I was later to understand, starts with curiosity, with a problem or a challenge, a question that you need to answer.[] Turning students into teachers of others is the best way for them to learn.When young people are maturing earlier it seems odd that we are steadily postponing the entry into serious work, asking for ever more evidence of scholastic achievement before paying anyone a wage. Better surely to pay them to learn while they work at every level, fitting in the university or college learning when it is appropriate.Large organisations are slowly realising that political ideas and theories often have more to tell them than management manuals. Federalism is a new curve whose time has come.Settling for an intermediate goal such as money is much easier than answering the really big question, -What is life for?- What is it all about?Survival not progress is what most settle for in the end.I keep a white stone on my desk. It is there because of a verse in the book of Revelation in the Bible which says, -To the one who overcomes, the angel said, I will give a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.-As a classroom exercise I have on occasion aske mature students to do the obituary exercise. -Imagine,- I tell them, -that you die in your mid-eighties. Your funeral is well attended and your best friend has agreed in advance to give the eulogy, but you asked him to keep it short. Write what you would like him to say in less than 300 word.-Frederick Wiseman is 84, he showed his latest documentary in Cannes in 2014. Asked why he goes on making films he said, -All my friends are either dead or still working.- There is always work to be done, a Second Curve waiting to be invented.

        <h4>Mathematical Analysis and Linear Algebra</h4>
        <div>
          Få tilsendt alle informationer om kurset, herunder kursus sted, udbyder mm. på emailMathematical Analysis and Linear AlgebraKurset dækker to områder af matematikken: lineær algebra og analyse af funktioner i mange variable. Lineær algebra er centralt i studiet af matricer som bruges til at repræsentere mange forskellige ting, herunder systemer af lineære ligninger, transformationer af rum og probabilistiske systemer. Ligesom mange af de interne operationer i søgemaskiner er baseret på matricer. Ved at studere den matematiske teori om matricer vil vi lære værktøjer, der har en række anvendelsesområder. Som et eksempel ser vi på PageRank algoritmen, som Googles søgemaskiner bruger til at rangere websider på basis af. På kurset udvides teorien om matematisk analyse også til funktioner af mange variabler. Analyse af funktioner med mange variable er teorien bag metoder, der bruges i kunstig intelligens, business intelligence, fysik og økonomi.Formålet med kurset er således at forstå den matematiske teori godt nok til at forstå, hvorfor metoderne inden for et anvendelsesområde virker og bruge den matematiske teori til at tilpasse eksisterende metoder og skabe nye. Med andre ord er målet ikke at den studerende blot skal kunne anvende metoder og indsætte i formler, men snarere forklare, hvorfor metoderne virker. Kurset foregår på engelsk og udbydes på kandidatuddannelsen: Software Development.Formelle forudsætninger:Please note! Changes to this course description may occur until start of the spring semester 2017.Læringsmål:After the course the student should be able to:- Use nummerical methods such as Newton's method and Taylor series, and explain the theory behind them.- Reflect on the applicability of a given numerical method to a given problem.- Compute the derivatives of curves and surfaces, explain the geometric interpretation of these, and apply them to solving a wide range of mathematical problems including optimisation problems.- Compute double integrals and explain their geometric interpretation.- Compute the essential constructions of basic linear algebra including inverse matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, matrix diagonalisation, the dimensions and bases of the four fundamental subspaces and determinants of square matrices, and explain the theory behind these constructions.- Explain the use of linear algebra in applications such as solutions to linear equations, the method of least squares and the theory of the PageRank algorithm. Discuss the relevance of the theoretical results proved in the course for these applications.Fagligt indhold:This is a course in mathematics covering linear algebra and analysis of functions in many variables. These are perhaps the two areas of mathematics that have found most uses in practical applications.Linear algebra is essentially the study of matrices, i.e., rectangular arrays of numbers. Matrices are used to represent many different things, including systems of linear equations, transformations of space (such as rotations or reflections as used in computer graphics) and probabilistic systems. Likewise, many of the internal operations in search engines are essentially operations on matrices. By studying the mathematical theory of matrices we will learn tools that are useful for all of these application areas. As an example application we look at the PageRank algorithm used in Google's search machines to rank webpages for importance.Mathematical analysis (or calculus) is the study of the derivative and the integral of real valued functions as taught in high school, but in this course we extend the theory to functions of many variables returning vectors of real numbers. Just like the single variable case, one of the main applications is to solve optimization problems, which in real life are of many variables. This is the theory underlying many methods in artificial intelligence, but it is also important in many other areas including image analysis, business intelligence, physics and economics.While the topics taught have been chosen for their applicability, the focus of the course will be on the mathematics. The aim is to understand the theory well enough that we can understand why the methods in the application areas work, and even use the mathematical theory to adapt existing methods or create new ones. In other words, the aim is not that the student should simply be able to use methods and insert into formulas, but rather explain why the methods work and reflect on the theory presented. For this reason the course has an oral exam.Læringsaktiviteter:14 ugers undervisning bestående af forelæsninger og øvelser14 weeks of teaching consisting of lectures and exercises. The exercise sessions will train the students oral presentation skills, and so students are expected to prepare for the exercise sessions. The mandatory exercises will mainly ask the students for written solutions to theoretical exercises, but will also include a few implementation exercises.Obligatoriske aktivititer: There are 6 mandatory assignments, out of which 5 must be approved for the student to qualify for the exam.The deadlines are evenly distributed over the semester (approximately one every 2 weeks), exact dates will be posted on learnit the first week of the semester.If a mandatory assignment is not approved the first time, the student will be allowed to resubmit exactly one week after the first deadline.If this also fails, one more resubmission the following week is allowed.Be aware: The student will receive the grade NA (not approved) at the ordinary exam, if the mandatory activities are not approved and the student will use an exam attemptEksamensform og -beskrivelse:B1I Mundtlig eksamen med forberedelse. På ITU, (7-scale, external exam)Oral examination with time for preparation at the exam.Duration: 30 minutes preparation at ITU and 30 minutes oral examination.The student draws a question and has 30 minutes preparation before 30 minutes oral examination.Litteratur udover forskningsartikler:- Gilbert Strang: Introduction to Linear algebra, 4th edition- David Guichard: Multivariable calculus, early transcendentals- Kurt Bryan and Tanya Leise: The $25,000,000,000 eigenvector, the linear algebra behind Google.

        <h4>Kunstig intelligens udpeget som stor trussel</h4>
        <div>
          IT Et nyt forskningscenter på University of Cambridge skal se på alvorlige trusler mod menneskehedens overlevelse. Et af de udpegede områder er kunstig intelligens, hvor tesen er, at intelligens i løbet af dette eller det næste århundrede slipper væk fra biologiens grænser. Professor i filosofiHuw Price fra universitetet i Cambridge forudser ifølge nyhedsbureauet AFP, at mennesket til den tid ikke længere vil være de klogeste, og at vi kommer til at eksistere som følge af lunet hos ' maskiner, som ikke er onde, men hvis interesser ikke inkluderer os'. »Der er en tendens til at betragte det som skørt at bekymre sig over kunstig intelligens, men når man tager risicienes alvor i betragtning, og at vi ikke kender tidshorisonten, så er det farligt at affeje bekymringerne,« siger Huw Price. Forskergruppen omfatter også professor emeritus inden for kosmologi og astrofysik Martin Rees og medstifter af Skype Jaan Tallinn.Foruden forskning i kunstig intelligens skal centret forske i truslen fra nanoteknologi og klimaforandringer. jak.Der er en tendens til at betragte det som skørt at bekymre sig over kunstig intelligens, men (...) det er farligt at affeje bekymringerne.Huw Price, professor, University of Cambridge.

        <h4>China Pledges Quality Growth, Tech Powerhouse in Five-Year Plan</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- China unveiled the first glimpses of its economic plans for the next five years, promising to build the nation into a technological powerhouse as it emphasized quality growth over speed. Initial details released by the Communist Party's Central Committee Thursday stressed the need for sustainable growth and also pledged to develop a robust domestic market. The communique released by state media following a four-day closed-door meeting didn't specify the pace of growth policy makers would target. The statement elevated China's self-reliance in technology into a national strategic pillar, a move signaled by officials from President Xi Jinping down in the lead the meeting. Central to that endeavor is self-reliance in chips, the building blocks for innovations from artificial intelligence to fifth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles. Beijing's efforts are gaining urgency as the U.S. seeks to contain the rise of its geopolitical rival. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., barred dozens of China's largest tech companies from buying American parts, and even slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat. Read More: The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier Unlike the last five-year plan, which sought to achieve &quot;medium-to-high growth&quot; in order to build a &quot;moderately prosperous society,&quot; this plenum had been expected to focus on the quality rather than the pace of growth. In Thursday's statement, officials pledged to stick to a strategy of boosting domestic demand and opening up the economy over the next five years. Even though the plan doesn't mention a specific rate of growth for gross domestic product, the government remains ambitious in its outlook. &quot;The leadership still expects the size of the economy, household income as well as GDP per capita to reach a 'new milestone' by 2035,&quot; said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. &quot;China did not abandon GDP targeting, it's just expressed in a more subtle way.&quot; While the strategy on &quot;dual circulation&quot; was mentioned twice in the communique, there wasn't any specific explanation or details of what it entails. The nation needs to &quot;smooth the domestic circulation, facilitate dual circulation at home and abroad, comprehensively promote consumption and expand room for investment,&quot; according to the statement. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Ford Elevating Farley to CEO After Hackett's Bid Falls Short</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said it will promote Jim Farley to chief executive officer on Oct. 1 to replace Jim Hackett, who has elected to retire after his three-year bid to turn around the automaker failed to gain traction. Farley, 58, became chief operating officer in March when his main internal rival was ousted following the botched launch of the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford's stock was routed under Hackett, 65, before the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the second-largest U.S. automaker's woes. Ford shares climbed as much as 3.3% during regular trading Tuesday. The stock had dropped almost 40% during Hackett's tenure through Monday's close. Read more: Ford's Stock Slump Under Hackett Exceeds Predecessor's Rout Last week, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss that was less than half the $5 billion deficit it had predicted, due in part to demand for its SUVs and trucks holding up better than feared. But some of the company's over-performance also could be chalked an on-paper gain from its investment in self-driving startup Argo AI. &quot;The wind in our sails is really starting to pick up, and Jim had a big, big role in that,&quot; Hackett said of Farley on a call with reporters. &quot;I can confident that the things I was asked to do have actually started taking root.&quot; Botched Explorer The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 outbreak hit Ford two years into an $11 billion restructuring that Hackett drew navigate the company out of a long slump. He saw the need to update a lineup that had gotten stale under his predecessor, Mark Fields, with greater connectivity features and electrified powertrains, and pulled Ford out of passenger-car segments in North America. But the first of those major redesigns, the Explorer, went horribly awry. The Chicago plant that underwent a major overhaul to build the revised SUV was plagued by personnel problems and struggled to get the vehicle out the door. Thousands were shipped to a Michigan factory hundreds of miles away for rework. In February, Ford announced the promotion of Farley, one of the two presidents seen as leading candidates to become the next CEO. The other, Joe Hinrichs, left the company. 'Smooth Transition' Farley will take over as Ford prepares to roll out three crucial new models aimed at reversing its fortunes: the electric Mustang Mach-E, the revived Bronco SUV and a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 pickup, its most profitable model. He promised to &quot;swing for the fences&quot; as Ford's leader, vowing to return the automaker to 10% profit margin in North America -- its long-standing goal -- and to have flawless launches of new models. &quot;We know our competition today is Amazon, Baidu, Tesla, Apple, Toyota, and others,&quot; Farley said. &quot;They're well-financed and voracious companies.&quot; Ford likely will seek to restore the dividend Hackett was forced to suspend in March when the coronavirus pandemic upended economies worldwide. Management had previously said the payout was sacrosanct, and cutting it off tested the faith of the founding family that had supported the CEO. Ford also lost its investment-grade credit ratings. &quot;Nothing makes me happier than having a smooth transition,&quot; Executive Chairman Bill Ford said during the call. &quot;This is something that we've been planning for some time. And it seemed liked the right time coming out of the second quarter when we performed much better than the world thought we would.&quot; (Updates with CEO's comment in the fifth paragraph.) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

          Computer kunst er måske en afart af menneskelig kunst, men det er stadig kunst, lyder argumentet herBut the honest-to-God truth, at the end of all of this, is that this whole notion is in some way a put-on: a distinction without a difference. -Computer art- doesn-t really exist in an any more provocative sense than -paint art- or -piano art- does. The algorithmic software was written by a human, after all, using theories thought up by a human, using a computer built by a human, using specs written by a human, using materials gathered by a human, at a company staffed by humans, using tools built by a human, and so on.

        <h4>Chinese AI Giant Blacklisted by Trump Thrives in Virus Era</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- The future of China's largest artificial intelligence company was thrown into question last year when it was blacklisted by the Trump administration.Today, SenseTime is thriving with growing demand for its facial recognition software, especially as local governments in China adopt its technology to battle the coronavirus. The Hong Kong-based startup's revenue surged 147% to 5 billion yuan ($720 million) in 2019 and its customer base increased by about 500 to 1,200 clients, according to co-founder Xu Bing. Sales are on track to climb 80% this year to about 9 billion yuan and gross profit could double, according to people familiar with the matter. &quot;We see business demand for ways to mitigate the virus outbreak on the rise,&quot; Xu said in a phone interview. He and SenseTime declined to comment on revenue projections in an emailed statement. That momentum has SenseTime contemplating an initial public offering. The company is close to completing a $1.5 billion funding round that values it at about $8.5 billion pre-money, paving the way for a stock sale, people familiar have said. The company -- whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp., Temasek Holdings Pte and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- is leaning toward a dual listing in Hong Kong and China, the people added. The Covid-19 pandemic has been extremely controversial ever since infections emerged in Wuhan eight months ago. Countries such as the U.S. blame Chinese authorities for censoring information about the outbreak that could have helped slow the spread. Now China's economy is recovering quickly from the crisis, while the U.S. and many others struggle to get back on track. Chinese authorities have succeeded by using laws and technologies that governments like the U.S. have resisted. When a cluster of Covid-19 patients flared up in northeastern China, the government installed sensors to guard the city's subway entrances. The cameras provided by SenseTime detect whether the passengers are wearing masks, their temperature, and even their identities with their faces covered. It's an example of how the ruling Communist Party, once wary of private entrepreneurs, is now supporting technology companies that have come under attack from the Trump administration, including SenseTime, Huawei Technologies Co., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd., parent of TikTok. The country has pledged to spend $1.4 trillion to develop its own tech industry and overtake the U.S. in key sectors.

Hard-line measures adopted by Beijing allow provincial governments, companies and residential complexes to deploy facial recognition devices with little . The temptation to use such technology more broadly against the virus has fueled privacy concerns. In April, more than 130 human rights groups published a letter cautioning against an expansion of surveillance powers. &quot;States cannot simply disregard rights such as privacy and freedom of expression in the name of tackling a public health crisis,&quot; it said in the letter. Still, business is booming for SenseTime. The company is working with 127 cities across China to use cameras to analyze everything from traffic to residential complex security. Its facial recognition program for subways, known as the Smart Commute System, is used in cities from central Zhengzhou and Xi'an to northeastern Harbin. Passengers can opt to register with the cities' subway apps to pay their transportation fee using face scans. That can allow them to be identified even with their masks on. The company declined to disclose how many people have selected the program, because the data sits with the respective city governments. The technology is possible in part because SenseTime zooms in on data points on a person's face not covered by a mask to enable identification, said Xu. And it's not the only one working on such technology. Wuhan University, for example, said it's developed competing software with 90% accuracy, according to a local media report. &quot;It's data gravity that nobody can stop. China is pushing facial recognition across the nation during this pandemic,&quot; said Isaac Mao, an angel tech investor. &quot;In the U.S., there are roadblocks including civil society, privacy regulations and governance structure to push back on facial recognition and companies profiting from it are facing a backlash, but in China this is what's missing.&quot; (Updates with SenseTime's backers in the fourth paragraph) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

          Autonome robotter/droner er udstyret med kunstig intelligens (AI), der tænker langt hurtigere end mennesker. Kunstig intelligens kan selv udvikle sin intelligens. Således har robotter kunnet udvikle et andet sprog til kommunikation, da menneskets sprog var for langsomt.I krig er hurtige beslutninger noget, man kan vinde en krig med. Derfor er det fristende at overlade krigens beslutninger til superhurtige dræberrobotter, men det vil betyde, at en atomkrig lettere vil kunne starte ved en fejl. Derfor kom og hør vort gadeteater om autonome dræberrobotter på FN's fredsdag den 21. september klokken 17.00 og klokken 17.30 i Heerups Have ved Hotel Britannia i Esbjerg.

        <h4>Buyer's Remorse 2.0: Newer isn't always better when it comes to Artificial Intelligence</h4>
        <div>
          Det er næsten altid en dårlig ide at udskyde implementering af AI, skriver John O'Niell, senior vice president ved Silent Eight.BrødtekstWhat triggers buyer's remorse? They say some people experience it seconds after driving a new car off the lot. For me, it sets in as soon as the honeymoon period with my new flat screen TV is over, and I realize I shouldn't have fallen in love with the first one I laid eyes on.We've all felt it, but that doesn't make it less painful. Fifteen years ago I spent over $20,000 on new inventory software, only to watch a completely revamped -- and cheaper! -- version renders it obsolete just two months later. That painful memory lingers with me still. Even today, with maintenance standards on almost every software purchase, I'm still a little gun shy. Especially when I'm buying something my coworkers will be using. Believe me, those folks have long memories.The exact same dynamics are at play when I talk to my customers about AI. There's plenty of research out there telling them buying is t he right decision. That AI is on the cutting edge of banking technology, and billions are being poured into research annually ($37.5 billion in 2019 alone, according to the International Data Corporation ).But none of that hype reassures most buyers. In fact, it makes them more apprehensive. Most can't help but wonder, &quot;Is this AI system going to be obsolete in a year?&quot;Many put off a purchase, figuring a delay will work to their advantage. After all, next year's version is bound to be better, right?But that's the funny thing about Artificial Intelligence - waiting is almost always a bad idea. That's because, unlike your new automobile or flatscreen TV, AI actually gets more valuable as it ages.Why the inverse dynamic?Learning through trial and errorWith most software, its capabilities are locked in the moment the code is complete. Try doing something the programmers didn't anticipate (like opening an unfamiliar file type), and the results can be ugly - anything from an error message to an application crash. Applications mature, of course, and each new version (usually) works better than the previous one, but you have to constantly play the update game.AI works differently. It doesn't need to be programmed, and it can learn just about anything. It can even learn through trial and error, the same way humans do.Let's suppose you're part of the KYC team at a bank, solving name screening alerts generated by your onboarding team, and you're working with an AI to do it. That AI investigates and makes decisions just like your best analysts (except a bit faster, naturally, solving over a million alerts per day).But no analyst is perfect right out of the gate, and smart as it is, the AI is no different. The day it started it was solving 40% of alerts without help. But after working at your side for a year, it's up to 80%.How? The AI learns from every single case it sees. The longer it's on the job, the more it learns - and the better it gets. Just like you do.To use a non-banking example, think about the recommendations social media makes for you. When I first signed up for Facebook, the paid content it suggested for me was laughably off-base (like most of us, I've gotten political ads for politicians I'd never vote for). But as time went by the recommendations became more focused, eventually narrowing in on things I actually did find interesting. Sure, the occasional online cooking class ads still shows up, but you learn to expect that when you use your work laptop to research the perfect guacamole recipe.Experience mattersSo why buy an AI system now, rather than waiting two years?Because a system with two years learning under its belt is vastly more useful than one that has to learn everything from scratch. It's the same reason that an employee who's been on your team for two years is more productive than a new hire. Experience matters.The fact is, it's only those banks that have learned not to think of AI like an old school software product - and regard it instead as an extremely skilled and eager-to-learn employee - that are truly tapping the enormous potential of this new technology.The two big investments that a bank makes in Artificial Intelligence are money and time. You might be tempted to postpone a purchase, thinking it may save money. But really, you're just losing valuable time.

        <h4>Demant A/S: Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids</h4>
        <div>
          30.11.2020 07:59:36 CET | Demant A/S |
    Investor NewsInvestor news30 November 2020 Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids  Greater Copenhagen, Denmark - Today, Demant, a global leader in hearing healthcare, is announcing the launch of new groundbreaking hearing aid technology in all its four hearing aid brands, Oticon, Philips Hearing Solutions, Bernafon and Sonic. The launch of new innovative hearing solutions strongly supports Demants purpose of delivering life-changing hearing health to people living with hearing loss. The new products will be launched in all major markets in the coming months and support millions of people in enjoying life to the fullest. Oticon is launching the new, revolutionary Oticon More, which is the worlds first hearing aid that allows users to hear all relevant sounds thanks to an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More is powered by an entirely new chipset, PolarisTM, boasting an eightfold increase in memory and twice the processing power compared to the previous generation, Velox STM. The all-new Polaris platform features seven processing cores, and due to its unique architecture, the 28 nanometer chipset delivers superior processing capabilities while optimising power consumption. Through years of innovation, research and collaboration with leading research institutions around the world, Oticon has built unique knowledge and understanding of how the brain perceives sound. Contrary to common belief, it is now established that the brain needs access to all sounds in the environment to function optimally. By applying this knowledge to hearing technology, we enable the hearing aid users to enjoy more complete sound landscapes and simply get more out of life when they use our products, says Søren Nielsen, President and CEO of Demant. In 2016, Oticon presented a paradigm shift in hearing care with Oticon OpnTM, which, for the first time ever, allowed users to get access to all speakers in the sound landscape to allow for better understanding and participation. This groundbreaking approach is fundamentally different from what traditional hearing aids do, as they apply directionality and only focus on the speaker in front, while suppressing all other sounds. Then, in 2019, the paradigm was further developed with the breakthrough feedback prevention system of Oticon Opn STM. With Oticon More, Oticon is now taking the next big step on its BrainHearingTM journey by introducing the worlds first purpose-built hearing aid platform with an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More utilises the intelligent capabilities of a Deep Neural Network to mimic the way the brain functions. It handles sounds based on the experience and training it has received. The Deep Neural Network in Oticon More is so much more than standard AI software - it is a unique and dedicated hearing aid solution, developed for real-time operation in everyday life. Based on our vast sound processing experience, we have trained the Deep Neural Network with 12 million sound scenes from real life. This optimises the way Oticon More makes sounds more distinct by working seamlessly across varying listening environments with unparalleled precision and clarity, while ensuring that the sound is comfortable for the user. With this integrated intelligence, Oticon More has learned to recognise all types of sounds, their details, and how they should ideally sound to optimally support the brain. As a result, Oticon More delivers 30% more information to the brain than Oticon Opn S, while reducing the listening effort of the user and improving speech understanding by 15%. Delivering breakthrough innovation and hearing care that improve the lives of people with hearing loss is what we are all about at Demant. It makes me proud that we are ready to launch the next generation of hearing aids that use deep learning, the most powerful of the AI techniques, to optimise hearing aid performance. Not only does it improve the brains hearing function, it also enables users to hear more with less effort, so they can enjoy and keep taking part in everyday life, says Søren Nielsen, President &amp; CEO of Demant. In addition to superior audiological performance, Oticon More features state-of-the-art direct streaming from both iOS and compatible Android devices using the ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) protocol and is prepared for the next generation of connectivity based on the upcoming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. This new, groundbreaking innovation from Oticon will be available in a miniRITE rechargeable style, in three upper price points and at four different power levels. Philips Hearing Solutions will soon launch the next generation of Philips HearLinkTM hearing aids. Featuring AI sound technology, the new hearing aid family will bring a significant change in hearing aid technology. It is developed to enable hearing aid users to connect with friends, family and colleagues, which is essential in order to live a social and active life. Philips HearLink is rechargeable, is able to stream directly from iOS and compatible Android devices and it is prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Bernafon and Sonic will also launch new hearing aids in the coming months. Specifically, Bernafon will introduce Bernafon Alpha that features Hybrid TechnologyTM, including a revolutionary approach to signal processing that always chooses the most optimal performance based on a precise analysis of the listening situation. Sonic will introduce Sonic Radiant, which comes with technology that actively finds, filters and fine-tunes sound so that the user can make the most of every moment. Both products feature direct streaming from iOS and compatible Android devices and are prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Over the coming weeks and months, the new flagship hearing aid families of our four hearing aid brands will be launched in all major markets. The products will be available in a range of price points and power levels - all based on the powerful miniRITE rechargeable style, which is built on state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. Starting today, our sales organisations will host a series of local launch events, conduct training sessions and launch marketing campaigns. Demant will host a virtual, live-streamed webcast today at 11:30am CET where key employees will present the new products in greater detail.

            Design Useful ML by Addressing Moments of Trust. Brødtekst TL, DR - Many ML applications are useful in theories, but they become useless in practice.Let's look at a real case study, highlight two types of biases, and how can understanding Moments of Trust can help with a concrete example. Finally, I leave you with 3 small actions to consider. The Story My inner voice : &quot;Is she having an affair? She must be. F*ck me!&quot; You can't blame me for having such thought when your beautiful wife suddenly spent so many nights away from home - she never had to work so much. So, I asked : &quot;What's going on? How come you seem so busy lately? Is everything okay?&quot; Jess : &quot;I don't know why you guys keep making these useless AI things , again ! They keep making us do more work.&quot; Well, I totally didn't see that coming. And ouch. As a loving husband, the right thing to do was to give her a hug and take on additional housework (yes, I did that.) More importantly, I needed to listen - well, for the sake of satisfying my selfish curiosity, the pursuit to better my own work, and the advancement of our ML community. So, I probed : &quot;Tell me more. What happened? Why do you say that?&quot; Two Types of Biases &amp; A Different Question J ess continued : &quot;We got this new Next Best Action app [an ML application]. Every week, it gives us a list of customers to call and product to offer. It's so damn useless I look at the list, I work with most of the customers, I know they won't buy the product  it's a waste of time, but we still have to do it to make our KPI look good. &quot; Jess just described two unique problems that every ML application faces. Let's unpack them: 1. Machine Bias . The machine is wrong, we, humans, are right. Machine Learning models aren't and can't be perfect - even we hope and perceive them to be. Humans see lots of data as we go about our day-to-day work, and subsequently, internalize it as intuition and knowledge, but such data may not be collected or represented properly in databases. As a result, the machine can't analyze fully and make better predictions with it. 2. Human Bias . The machine is right, we are wrong. Humans subject to Overconfidence Bias . In other words, we usually overestimate the accuracy of our predictions, especially in our domain of expertise. Perhaps, the machine actually knows more and up-to-date information than we do, so it produces better predictions. But we trust ourselves more than the machine. Many of us in the ML community may immediately ask: how can we fix the machine (e.g. the models)? Companies are hiring better data science talents, putting more rigorous ML Ops practices in place, and upgrading to better tools . But, doing these only solves the machine bias problem. A chain is as strong as the weakest link: the users of ML applications. We can't eliminate innate human biases, but we can design for trust With trust, users are more open to collaborating with machines. So, How might we foster trust between users and ML applications? - this is the question we should ask instead. Let's walk through a specific example and discuss how we can design for trust with Moment of Trust analysis and simple UX techniques Moments of Trust Caveat: the example below is inspired by Jess's work as a frontline who need to service clients in person. Although it focuses on one use case, the principles apply to many processes where humans need to take information from ML apps and decide how to act. To get a clearer and more specific picture of the problems, first, we should take a look at the Moments of Trust - the split seconds when humans need to make a judgement call based on their trust in the machines. We can highlight these moments by using a User Journey analysis Imagine when you go to a branch of a bank and meet with an advisor, here is a typical journey from the lens of advisor - the user of an ML application: Understanding the Moments of Trust helps us to find the specific pressure points when users might struggle with predictions from ML systems. Let's unpack the problems of each Moment of Trust reveals. Deeper Problems &amp; Solutions Moment of Trust #1 : Let's look at Step 4. This is the moment when the users see the predictions, understand what the predictions mean, and decide if they should and how to act. Problems: Users don't act upon the predictions. Typically, users see a simple description of what to offer or to do (see illustration on the left). When users need to decide if they want to follow, either they take a blind faith or lean towards their judgements of the moment. We tend to choose the latter given our Overconfidence Bias In other words, many predictions - the ones that Data Scientists spend hearts and souls creating - never really &quot;go into the market&quot;, they just flash on the users' screens, then disappear. This leads to two additional problems. First, user-machine interaction will be captured as &quot;failed&quot; in the database for the wrong reason. The machine thinks the interaction failed because of mathematical mistakes, but in reality, it failed because users didn't act or did it properly. Second, when the machines learn, they learn the wrong reality. This is known as the feedback loop problem (we will discuss below). As a result, it creates vicious loops of producing non-sensible predictions and ultimately ruins the trust of users. These are not prediction problems. They are UX problems. Goals: The main goals for this step should be two folds: 1) increase the percentage of action taken and 2) improve the quality of the action. Solutions: With this in mind, I propose to replace out-of-context suggestions with a contextual prompt . The contextual prompt should highlight the &quot;why&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, and &quot;how&quot; of executing an ML prediction with human-readable language (illustration on the left) . Depends on the type of algorithm, there are various ways to translate machine decisions into human-readable language. Problems: Users can't provide good feedback. Typically, this interface allows users to track their progress and coordinate with other members, however, it's often not designed to capture feedback for the ML apps (the users are also not incentivized to do so). As mentioned previously, a broken or poor feedback loop creates problems for ML models to learn from mistakes. Just like humans, good feedback allows us to learn better and faster. Goals: At this step, the main goal is to encourage users to share better feedback, for themselves and the machines. Solutions : The simplest solution is to use UI elements that are familiar to most people, these UI elements can help to standardize inputs and shorten the time to input information. In addition to offering a UX for capturing feedback, the ML app can also share how it uses the feedback to improve future predictions. This can create a sense of participation and reward for the users. Note: all screenshots are cleansed for confidentiality. They represent common elements from organizations with similar applications. One Step At A Time In fact, the &quot;useless ML experience&quot; is a recurring theme. Jess and I experienced a similar issue on a different occasion. As I described in The Last Mile Problems of AI , it comes down to a disconnection in human-AI collaboration . Solving the problem requires an integrated approach to address issues on three fronts. What happens if we don't solve this problem? Everyone will be upset if we don't solve the trust problem. Users like Jess will keep complaining about how useless &quot;AI things&quot; are and not benefit from amazing technologies because of self-biases, data scientists may lose their jobs because the real results of the models will never match the wishful estimations, businesses will never actualize the promise values of AI, most importantly, I will have to keep listening to Jess, my friends in data science, and my clients complaining about each other. There are many steps we need to take to build useful ML applications. Designing for Trust is a great, and simple, first step. Take action now. Suggested Actions identify a user-facing ML use case at your company incorporate the User Journey and Moment of Trust analysis into your ML design workflow host a collaborative design session based on the Moment of Trust with representatives from data science, engineering, and user group (e.g. frontline). Conclusion Many ML apps are deemed to be useless by users, not because of the accuracy of predictions, but because of human biases. It's our responsibility to design for trust as designers and developers of ML applications. The solutions often are simple. By identifying the Moment of Trust , we can design effective UX to provide more contextual predictions and close the feedback loop that enables continuous improvement. In reality, we, the humans, and machines are both imperfect. Designing for trust offers something beyond quick fixes - it creates a bridge for humans and machines to calibrate our trust and improve together. Like What You Read?

        <h4>The EU should regulate AI on the basis of rights, not risks</h4>
        <div>
          EU vil have virksomheder til at evaluere deres operationelle risici op imod grundlæggende menneskerettigheder. Det er en grundlæggende misforståelse af, hvad menneskerettigheder er, skriver repræsentanter fra Acces Now i dette synspunkt.BrødtekstIn only a few months the European Commission is set to present a regulation on artificial intelligence (AI). Despite numerous statements from civil society and other actors about the dangers of applying a risk-based approach to regulating AI, the European Commission seems determined to go in this direction. The Commission already said in its 2020 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence that it wanted to apply a risk-based approach.A risk-based approach involves determining the scale or scope of risks related to a concrete situation and a recognised threat. This approach is useful in technical environments where companies have to evaluate their own operational risks. However, the EU approach would have companies evaluate their operational risks vs. people's fundamental rights. This is a fundamental misconception of what human rights are, they cannot be put in a balance with companies' interests. Companies would also have an interest in downplaying the risks in order to develop products. A risk-based approach to regulation is therefore not adequate to protect human rights. Our rights are non-negotiable and they must be respected regardless of a risk level associated with external factors.We have heard people make numerous references to how a risk-based approach would take its lead from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is worrying precisely because the GDPR is not fundamentally a risk-based law, and the parts that deal with risk assessment have proven highly problematic.As we explain below, the upcoming legislative proposal on AI should be a rights-based law, like the GDPR, as this is the only way to ensure the protection of fundamental rights. The European Commission must not compromise our rights by substituting a mere risk mitigation exercise by the very actors with a vested interest in rolling out this technology.Why the GDPR is not a risk-based lawThroughout the negotiations of the GDPR and since its adoption in 2016, many in industry have claimed that the law ''enshrines'' or ''establishes'' a risk-based approach to data protection. That is not the case.The GDPR does include references to risks and defines the requirements for conducting a risk assessment in specific scenarios, such as when there is a data breach. However, the GDPR is based on rights and making them operational. It sets out a series of rights to enable us to control our information and then places obligations and requirements on companies and other entities that use our data, to protect those rights. In fact, during the negotiations of the GDPR, the Working Party 29 - which gathers all EU data protection authorities - published a statement on the risk-based approach to explain that it cannot replace company obligations to protect our rights:''the Working Party is concerned that both in relation to discussions on the new EU legal framework for data protection and more widely, the risk-based approach is being increasingly and wrongly presented as an alternative to well-established data protection rights and principles, rather than as a scalable and proportionate approach to compliance. The purpose of this statement is to set the record straight.''The statement further clarifies that ''rights granted to the data subject by EU law should be respected regardless of the level of the risks which the latter incur through the data processing involved''. The data protection authorities have not since changed their opinion on the matter. The guidelines the European Data Protection Board recently issued confirm that the risk-based approach under the GDPR is limited to a few articles and clarifies that other obligations continue to apply.The development of AI and automated decision-making (ADM) systems poses great risks to fundamental rights. There is mounting evidence to show how these systems can violate our rights. We are seeing the use of live facial recognition systems in public spaces that amounts to mass surveillance , the deployment of publicly funded pseudoscientific AI ''lie detector'' systems along national borders, the use of biased, problematic ADM systems to detect welfare fraud , and even use of relatively basic ADM systems that entrench and amplify inequality in grading students.The fact that AI systems can operate in unpredictable ways, and that systems that ostensibly perform ''simple'' or routine tasks can end up having unforeseen and often highly damaging consequences, deepens the risks. A good example is the use of automated gender recognition technology, where machine learning systems are trained to ''detect'' someone's gender from facial or other characteristics. While such systems are widespread and usually considered trivial, they have been shown to systematically discriminate against trans and gender non-conforming people by either misgendering them or forcibly assigning them a gender identity that does not match their true gender identity.From a fundamental rights perspective, these two considerations - the evidence that there is a threat to our rights, and that AI and ADM systems can act in unpredictable ways - should lead to a proposal for a proper human rights impact assessment by independent experts and regulators, both ex ante and on a regular basis once the systems are in use. Unfortunately that is not what the European Commission proposed in its communication on the upcoming AI regulations.Rather than focusing on fundamental rights, the Commission's stated approach to regulating AI has been to place innovation and increased AI uptake as its primary concern. Protecting rights is acknowledged as a secondary concern, with the worrying proviso that it must only be done in a manner that does not risk stifling innovation.This insistence on protecting innovation and increasing AI uptake at all costs seems to be one of the main motivations behind the proposal to adopt a risk-based approach to regulation. The Commission's White Paper on Artificial Intelligence lays the groundwork for this approach by proposing distinguishing between high- and low-risk AI systems. In addition, a study commissioned by the European Parliament's Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA), The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on artificial intelligence, envisions a ''risk-based approach, [which] rather than granting individual entitlements, focuses on creating a sustainable ecology of information, where harm is prevented by appropriate organisational and technological measures''.How would such an approach work? The Commission's White Paper proposes using two cumulative criteria to assess risk, ''considering whether both the sector and the intended use involve significant risks, in particular from the viewpoint of protection of safety, consumer rights and fundamental rights'' (p.17). This suggests that to trigger regulatory protections, an AI system would need to be used in a sector identified as high risk (such as health) and ''used in such a manner that significant risks are likely to arise''. The White Paper leaves open the possibility that ''the use of AI applications for certain purposes is to be considered as high-risk as such'' and cites the use of AI in hiring and in remote biometric identification systems.Why a rights-based approach is the way to goIn our response to the consultation on the Commission's White Paper, we outlined the many problems with the risk-based approach it proposes. One clear issue is that dangerous applications that fall through the cracks and are wrongly classified as ''low risk'' will not be subject to proper oversight and safeguards. We therefore proposed that the burden of proof be on the entity wanting to develop or deploy the AI system to demonstrate that it does not violate human rights via a mandatory human rights impact assessment (HRIA). This requirement would be for all applications in all domains, and it should apply to both the public and private sector, as part of a broader due diligence framework.Once such an impact assessment has been conducted, there could then be a role for some form of risk assessment to define the consequences of that assessment. Regardless, we caution against taking a simplistic high-low risk binary approach, and further encourage the Commission to develop clear and coherent criteria to determine when an AI or ADM system has a significant effect on an individual, a specific group, or society at large.Most importantly, however, the Commission needs to account for the fact that even a ''high-risk'' classification will be inadequate for the danger posed by some uses of AI. With applications of AI such as remote biometric identification, automated gender ''detection'', and other forms of behavioural prediction, it is not a question of whether these applications of AI pose a ''risk'' to human rights, they are fundamentally incompatible with the enjoyment and protection of human rights. Framing the problem in terms of risk encourages the idea that we could introduce safeguards or ethical guidelines that would ''lower the risk''. In reality, some systems inherently undermine our rights and our dignity in a manner that cannot be mitigated.Together with 61 other civil society organisations in Europe, Access Now has called for the Commission to ensure that its regulatory proposal on AI makes provision for ''red lines'' or prohibitions on certain applications, such as those that would deepen structural discrimination, exclusion, and collective harms, or those that serve to restrict or grant discriminatory access to vital services such as health care and social security. Perhaps most urgently, our coalition is calling for a ban on biometric mass surveillance.We believe that the European Union can only live up to its promise of promoting ''trustworthy AI'' if it takes a rights-based approach and bans outright those applications of AI that are inherently incompatible with fundamental rights.

        <h4>Maskless Xi, China's Modest GDP Target, Hong Kong: NPC Update</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China's most senior officials gathered in Beijing to kick off the annual full-session of the country's parliament, the National People's Congress.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang unveiled a conservative target for economic growth this year of above 6% that signals more restrained monetary and fiscal policies this year, in contrast to other major nations still pumping in stimulus. But China's new five-year plan that runs through 2025 didn't give a numeric target for average growth.What to Know:Click here to read more on this year's NPCEverything you need to knowFull NPC reports. Highlights hereA QuickTake explainer on the NPCWhat to watch out for this yearBloomberg Intelligence previews the NPC. Reaction to GDP goalHow China plans to be greener by 2025Clips of other reactions here and here. Key takeaways hereLatest developments: (Time-stamps are local time in Beijing)The opening session of the NPC at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesUpcoming Events: Foreign Minister, 5-Year Plan BriefingKey upcoming NPC events that have been announced so far include:March 7, afternoon - Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks to mediaMarch 8, 10 a.m. - NDRC Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe discusses 14th five-year plan at briefingMarch 8, 3 p.m. - NPC plenary session, with delegates listening to work reports delivered by NPC standing committee chairman, head of of the supreme court and the top procuratorMarch 11, 3 p.m. - NPC closing session. Delegates will vote on work reports, 14th Five-Year Plan, and other legislative revisions including decision on revising Hong Kong's electoral systemMaskless Xi (2:22 p.m.)Despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all - including President Xi Jinping - appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country's biggest political gathering of the year.While officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People's Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year's NPC, seen as a statement on China's virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.Delegates applaud as Xi Jinping arrives for the opening session of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesExport to Rise More Than 50% (2:20 p.m.)China's exports may have risen more than 50% in January to February, He Lifeng, head of the nation's economic planning agency, said in a group interview. Power consumption and generation increased by more than 20%, the economy kept improving in the first two months, though the external environment poses challenges to the Chinese economy, he said.Family Offices Overhaul (12:30 p.m.)Xiao Gang, former chairman of China's securities regulator, proposed revising the nation's family trust law, saying impediments such as high taxes have forced many family trusts to hoard cash rather than make investments, according to the China Securities Journal.Assets controlled by China's wealthiest people are expected to double from 2019 to 116 trillion yuan ($18 trillion) by 2025, according to UBS Global Research. But according to a Credit Suisse Group AG report in October, wealth inequality has also risen rapidly, estimating that the country had 5.8 million millionaires and 21,100 residents had wealth of above $50 million - more than any country except the U.S. - at the end of 2019.Steelmakers Optimistic (12:27 p.m.)Chinese steelmakers are optimistic for this year as the nation's efforts to decarbonize and consolidate the industry continue, the China Economic Times reported, citing steel mill executives at the National People's Congress. Demand will improve this year, benefiting from high growth targets set by local governments at the start of the 14th five-year plan, according to Xia Wenyong, chairman of Xinyu Iron &amp; Steel Group. Steel production may drop marginally after the country's pledge to cut output from a record high last year, said Li Lijian, chairman of Anyang Iron &amp; Steel Group.Feeding 1.4 Billion Mouths (12:25 p.m.)China rolled out a to boost crop production in the world's most populous nation, highlighting concerns over food security after the country imported record amounts of meat, corn and soybeans last year. Measures include creating agricultural belts devoted to large-scale farming and providing sufficient subsidies to motivate grain farmers, according to the latest five-year plan that sets out key economic and political goals through 2025.Food security is moving to the top of the government's agenda after the coronavirus pandemic and outbreaks of African swine fever raised concerns over whether China could guarantee food supplies for its 1.4 billion people. Imports of meat and grains surged last year, driving global prices higher and stoking worries over food inflation.Fresh Blow to Tech Giants (12:27 p.m.)China called on its technology giants to share key data, dealing a further blow to the companies already reeling from heightened antitrust scrutiny.Companies are encouraged to open up data related to areas from search to e-commerce and social media, in order to promote the healthy development of the sharing and online economies, according to a government report outlining the Communist Party's top priorities for the next five years. Beijing is also establishing a platform for sharing public and government data.China also pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence in its latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.Biosecurity (11:45 a.m.)China plans to ramp up the construction and management of biosecurity labs to prepare for future emerging diseases, while it also grapples with allegations from the U.S. that the coronavirus outbreak could have resulted from a lab leak.The country seeks to ''comprehensively enhance biosecurity governance capabilities'' by improving its monitoring and emergence preparedness, according to a document outlining major policy priorities through 2025. The report was released Friday as lawmakers from the world's second-largest economy meet in Beijing for the annual parliamentary session.More Oversight of Ant? (11:30 a.m.)China plans to step up oversight of financial holding companies and the nation's booming fintech industry, Premier Li Keqiang said, setting the tone for closer scrutiny over the next five years of behemoths including Jack Ma's Ant Group Co.The authorities will also expand an anti-monopoly crackdown and prevent the ''unregulated'' expansion of capital to create fair competition, Li said Friday at the opening of the National People's Congress. The fintech sector should be developed in a ''prudent'' manner and China aims to create a ''deviation correction'' mechanism to fix and suspend innovative financial products when needed, according to a separate plan covering policies for 2021 to 2025.China's s are walking a fine line of trying to curb risks at home while encouraging local champions as the economy opens wider to foreign capital. Fintech has become the latest target of scrutiny since the nation's leaders pledged in 2017 to clean up threats to its $53 trillion financial industry, tackling property loans, opaque wealth management products and fraud-riddled peer-to-peer lending.Overhauling H.K. Electoral System (11:16 a.m.)China is curbing the ability of democracy activists to win elections in Hong Kong, with local reports saying a vote for the territory's legislature would be delayed another year to September 2022.The National People's Congress will review a draft resolution on changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in the coming days, according to an agenda published Thursday by the official Xinhua News Agency. For weeks Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials have called for ''patriots'' to run Hong Kong, effectively signaling that anybody deemed disloyal to Beijing couldn't hold a leadership position.Carrie Lam at the opening ceremony of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesSeparately, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the city will amend local election legislation after China's top legislative body passes new election rules for the city's leader and lawmakers. The amendments will be tabled at the legislature for vetting, the principle of ''patriots ruling Hong Kong'' is fully in line with constitutional requirements of the city and ''One Country, Two Systems'' will be placed in jeopardy if forces that oppose China and stir up trouble in Hong Kong enter the political system via elections, she said.Tackling Housing (11:02 a.m.)China pledged to solve the housing problem in large cities at its top legislative session, as monetary loosening after the pandemic spurred a rush to real estate in the biggest hubs, pushing home affordability there to the worst ever.''We will address prominent housing issues in large cities,'' Premier Li Keqiang said. Li echoed President Xi Jinping's mantra that houses are ''for living in, not for speculation'' in the key report, signaling that policy makers may maintain a tight rein on the bubble-prone sector. ''We will keep the prices of land and housing as well as market expectations stable,'' he said.Boosting Usage of Non-Fossil Fuels (10:52 a.m.)In its 14th 5-year plan released Friday, China said it plans non-fossil fuels to account for 20% of energy use by 2025, versus 15% at the end of 2019. The country is also targeting it nuclear power capacity to increase about 40% to 70 gigawatts by 2025.China will also boost oil-and-gas exploration, expand its gas pipeline network, improve coal transportation and increase its ability to ensure supply.More Charging Stations for Electric Cars (10:40 a.m.)China aims to boost auto sales and add more charging facilities for electric vehicles this year. The government will encourage ''steady increases'' in spending on cars and ''abolish excessive restrictions'' on the sale of used vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. More car parks, EV charging stations and battery-swapping facilities will be built, and battery recycling systems developed at a faster pace, Li said.Premier Calls for Breakthroughs in Core Tech (10:29 a.m.)In his address Friday, Premier Li Keqiang outlined steps the government will take to make China into a global tech power. That includes building more national laboratories and innovation centers, as well as ramping up efforts to implement a little-heard of program called the Sci-Tech Innovation 2030 Agenda. Li also said China's R&amp;D spending will increase by more than 7% per year, which ''is expected to account for a higher percentage of GDP'' than during the previous five-year plan.Defense Budget Growth Fastest in Two Years (10:20 a.m.)China's defense spending is expected to grow 6.8% this year to 1.35 trillion yuan ($208 billion), according a budget report released today. That would be the fastest pace in two years. ''We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations,'' Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report.Boosting Trade with U.S. Allies (10:05 a.m.)China may join an Asia-Pacific trade pact comprised of key U.S. allies that former President Donald Trump exited, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. In his work report, Li said Beijing ''will actively consider joining'' the 11-nation agreement known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It includes nations that China has sparred with recently such as Australia, Canada and Japan.China Stocks Fall 10% From Recent Peak (9:59 a.m.)A screen displays a live news broadcast of Li Keqiang speaking at the National People's Congress in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Qilai Shen/BloombergChinese markets opened as Premier Li Keqiang was delivering his work report at the NPC and continued their recent slide, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index dropping as much as 2% at the start of trading. That put the index down 10% from a peak reached on Feb. 10. The rout has come amid growing concern that Beijing will begin to tighten liquidity conditions as the country's economy recovers from the effects of the coronavirus.Cuts in Carbon Emissions (09:43 a.m.)China will devise a plan for carbon emissions to peak by 2030 and is targeting an 18% cut per unit of GDP by 2025, according to Premier Li's work report. The nation will also aim for a 3% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP in 2021 and a 13.5% reduction by 2025.Tencent's Pony Ma Makes Proposals (09:16 a.m.)Tencent founder and Chief Executive Pony Ma, who is an NPC delegate, is attending this year's event in Beijing and submitted a proposal for better preserving China's natural resources. Ma's whereabouts have attracted attention after he skipped last year's NPC and was also absent from several major Tencent events due to health reasons.China Sets Modest GDP Target for 2021 (09:00 a.m.)China set a conservative economic growth target of above 6% for the year, well below what economists forecast, and outlined ongoing fiscal support to keep the country's recovery going. Other key economic targets include:Fiscal deficit target set at 3.2% of GDP for 2021, versus 3.6% in 2020CPI target set at 3% for 2021, versus around 3.5% in 2020Target for new urban job creation set at 11 million in 2021, versus 9 million in 2020Special government bond quota set at 3.65 trillion yuan in 2021, versus 3.75 trillion yuan in 2020©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra Bilderberg MeetingsMONTREUX, 28 MAY 2019- The 67th Bilderberg Meeting will take place from 30 May - 2 June 2019 in Montreux, Switzerland. About 130 participants from 23 countries have confirmed their attendance. As ever, a diverse group of political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia, labour and the media has been invited. The list of participants is available on bilderbergmeetings.org.The key topics for discussion this year are:1. A Stable Strategic Order2. What Next for Europe?3. Climate Change and Sustainability4. China5. Russia6. The Future of Capitalism7. Brexit8. The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence9. The Weaponisation of Social Media10. The Importance of Space11. Cyber ThreatsFounded in 1954, the Bilderberg Meeting is an annual conference designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. Every year, between 120-140 political leaders and experts from industry, finance, labour, academia and the media are invited to take part in the Meeting. About two thirds of the participants come from Europe and the rest from North America, approximately a quarter from politics and government and the rest from other fields.The Bilderberg Meeting is a forum for informal discussions about major issues. The meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor any other participant may be revealed.Thanks to the private nature of the Meeting, the participants take part as individuals rather than in any official capacity, and hence are not bound by the conventions of their office or by pre-agreed positions. As such, they can take time to listen, reflect and gather insights. There is no detailed agenda, no resolutions are proposed, no votes are taken and no policy statements are issued.Kontakt:Media contact: media[@]bilderbergmeetings.orgLæs hele pressemeddelelsen på Via Ritzau her: https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/67th-bilderberg-meeting-to-take-place-30-may---2-june-2019-in-montreux-switzerland?releaseId=13574365

            DIKU Bits: What is causality? Speaker Jonas Peters, Professor at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, UCPH Abstract In the field of causality we want to understand how a system reacts under interventions (e.g. in gene knock-out experiments). These questions go beyond statistical dependences and can therefore not be answered by standard regression or classification techniques. In this talk we will learn about the interesting problem of causal inference. No prior knowledge about causality is required. Zooming in on Jonas Peters Which courses do you teach (BSc and MSc)? Recently, I taught MASD and MAD (both BSc, DIKU). Out of the courses I teach at MATH, maybe Optimization in Data Science (MSc) and Causality (MSc) could be relevant for DIKU students. Also, next year, I will teach SS in the new Bachelor program &quot;Machine learning og datavidenskab&quot; (BSc, DIKU &amp; MATH). Which technology/research/projects/startup are you excited to see the evolution of? Applications of machine learning/AI in the natural sciences. What is your favorite sketch from the DIKUrevy? I have to admit that so far, I only attended the Matematikrevy. But I am sure DIKUrevy has some nice songs, too. I love music!

        <h4>Majority of Promising AI Startups Are Still Based in the U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- The most promising startups using artificial intelligence are U.S.-based companies working in the fields of health care, retail and transportation, according to a study that looked at budding AI companies around the world. Of the top 100 startups in AI, 65% were based in the U.S., though some of those had dual headquarters in China or elsewhere, according to the analysis by CB Insights, a tech research group that analyzed data on close to 5,000 startups around the world. &quot;These would be companies to watch that are doing really interesting research in AI,&quot; said Deepashri Varadharajan, the lead analyst on the report. &quot;Some of them might get acquired. Some might have successful product launches.&quot; The research group considered venture capital investment, patent activity and market potential to develop its list of the companies most likely to succeed. The high percentage of U.S.-based companies reflect the country's historical dominance in AI research, Varadharajan said. More than 4,300 startups in 80 countries have raised $83 billion since 2014, including $26.6 billion just last year, according to CB Insights. While the dollar figures for investment have grown rapidly, the share of U.S.-based investments dropped in that period to 39% from 71%. &quot;The U.S. still has the most number of deals, but that deal share has started to drop as other countries are starting to fund technologies,&quot; she said. &quot;The vast majority are automating specific tasks in white-collar settings.&quot; That echoes a Brookings Institution study last year that found white-collar jobs are most likely to see an impact from AI, particularly in the life sciences and computer industries. Top ranked firms in the CB Insights ranking included several unicorns, or startups whose private valuations reached $1 billion or more. These include the following: Butterfly Network, which is building an ultrasound device that uses AI-assisted diagnostics, Faire Wholesale Inc., which helps local retailers determine what goods are predicted to sell best in specific locations, and DataRobot, whose tools help companies develop their own AI applications. Some of the startups already have begun work with larger companies, including Caspar.AI, a U.S. and Japan-based firm that's working with Panasonic Corp. on smart home products and ClimaCell Inc., a climate-monitoring firm that's partnered with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. Google also is working with U.K.-based InstaDeep Ltd., which builds AI systems for other companies in the fields of logistics, energy and electronic design. What the companies have in common is that they are addressing a need within specific industries and, in many cases, breaking through bottlenecks, Varadharajan said. &quot;You can be using AI, that's great, but is there a problem that you're trying to solve?&quot; she said. &quot;It can be an industry-specific need or pushing the boundaries of core research itself.&quot; The health-care startups were looking at diagnostics, health monitoring and enhancing imaging. AI companies are working to develop commuter modeling, waste recycling and mapping for city planning. Improving the energy grid, anti-fraud features in the finance industry, and indoor farming are some of the other areas where AI is being used. Some future trends she pointed to include energy efficiency, improving quantum computing and doctored videos called deepfakes. --With assistance from Alex Tanzi.

        <h4>The EU Rules on Artificial Intelligence - Five actions to consider now</h4>
        <div>
          On April 21st, it released the long-awaited proposal for harmonized regulations on AI. Understanding the basics of the new rules and the organizational impact is a requirement for all senior executives.For a couple of years, the EU Commission has worked on rules, regulations, and incentives around Artificial Intelligence. On April 21st, it released the long-awaited proposal for harmonized regulations on AI.The proposal to be adopted in national legislation is a far-reaching set of rules that will impact all organizations, at par and perhaps even more comprehensive, than GDPR.Understanding the basics of the new rules and the organizational impact is a requirement for all senior executives.Announcement detailsThe announcement includes a large number of new requirements for organizations, whether providers or users of AI. Not all the specific actions for organizations are immediately apparent in the EU Commission's summary nor clear from the press coverage following the announcement. However, the main points of the announcement are:Levels of AI Risk: The central and critical element of the announcement is the splitting of AI solutions and products into four categories according to risk. The proposal defines AI risk as to the ability to consciously and unconsciously manipulate humans, violate people's rights, pose a danger to people or enable social scoring or segmentation. The risk categories are:Unacceptable risk, such as systems that manipulate a human's free willHigh risk, examples of which are transportation that may pose a threat to humans, scoring of people in credit or employment situations, AI in machinery such as operating robots, or AI in policing situations. The number of high-risk AI usage areas is significant and will require actions to be taken by providers of products or services using AI and users deploying these AI products and services.Limited risk, which can be simple chatbots or simple machinery operations.Minimal risk, such as simple tools for non-critical situations and using non-critical data.A product or service may move with risk categories over time, meaning that the placement in a risk category is not fixed.Application of AI rules : The new rules apply to any organization, provider, or user offering an AI product or solution even if the solution runs on a platform outside the EU but is offered virtually within an EU country. The rules also apply to machinery with AI embedded. (This has led to enhancements in the EU rules applying to machinery products). The EU rules for AI are expected will evolve and will be governed by national and EU-level oversight boards.Monitoring and tracking : The rules require providers of products and services that incorporate AI to monitor and track the data, functionality, and intent and do so over time. IN other words, track the AI risk level. However, the risk categorization of an AI product or solution is not static and may evolve. This may happen as the product or solution evolves either through changes made by the provider or as the user of the product or service incorporates new data sets or AI functionality. Tracking high-risk AI solutions and products will happen at the national level and be included in an EU central database. As part of this tracking, high-risk AI products and services will be certified through a CE mark. Thus, allowing users to understand the AI risk of products and solutions purchased more clearly.Implementation in legislation : The proposal from the commission will now need to be discussed, possibly amended a few places, and then adopted and incorporated into national legislation. However, the timing of this remains a little vague, albeit not far into the future. Once that happens, organizations with business in the EU countries will need to comply with the rules and put the responsibility on leaders in every organization.Penalties: The rules carry the potential for significant penalties for not complying with the regulations. The maximum penalty would be 30 million Euro or 6 percent of the previous year's turnover, whichever is the largest.A few things will require clarification or evolve as AI and its usage increase.First, the document distinguishes between a provider and a user. However, over time, everyone using AI will become a provider, given that data and algorithms, and models become the core fabric of every organization. So, the distinction will make less and less sense.Secondly, monitoring and tracking will require two things that are not explicit in the rules. The first is clarity on who audits the risk level of the product or solution. The AI rules would benefit from having a third party that continuously audit the AI risk level of all AI models and algorithms across the organization. This is essential given the increasing complexity, breadth, and adaptability of AI in all organizations. The second is a requirement to install technology that tracks all AI models and algorithms. Only technology will be able to report on usage continuously. The specificity of the oversight and monitoring lacks in the current version of the rules, and a common EU approach to audit and monitoring would benefit all organizations.Third and last, the devil is always in the detail, and the challenge becomes determining the boundaries, for example, between high-risk and limited-risk AI products and solutions. Ultimately, this is why there is an organizational requirement to monitor and track AI products and solutions to deal with disputes. This is equally why the proposal from the EU deep in the document suggests that organizations adopt and voluntary, explicit, and transparent approach to external communication about their usage of AI.The rules will evolve through the review and implementation process. And they are not perfect. However, they will impact every organization and will require executive teams to take action now. There are five key actions to consider.The board's involvement : The EU proposal has made AI a question of risk or assessment of risk. Ultimately, it becomes the board's responsibility or, in the case of public sector organizations, the political oversight function. Boards need to determine how to deal with AI risk, ethics, and governance continuously and who at the board level should assume ownership. Action: It is recommended for organizations with business in the EU to have the EU regulation and AI risk as an agenda item on the board agenda this year.Business leader accountability : Given that AI implementations constantly evolve as more advanced models learn and morph in function and ultimately support humans, so must oversight. There will be a constant need for business leaders to monitor and understand AI products and solutions first and second-order impacts. Furthermore, given the increasing ubiquity of AI in organizations, this responsibility and accountability can't be centralized but rests with all business leaders. Action: All organizations implementing AI need to commence an education of senior business leaders around the impact and their responsibilities concerning AI and AI risk on their function.Particular action is required of the CIO, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO). They must ensure a corporate-wide effort is initiated where managers are made aware of their ongoing responsibility for monitoring AI products and solutions.The Chief Legal officer will need to become familiar with the legal requirements, likely by involving outside counsel and inform the CEO and board of the requirements. Equally, he or she is required to ensure that the appropriate oversight processes are in place, likely in collaboration with the CIO and the CHRO.The CHRO needs to ensure that accountable managers are informed of their responsibilities and built into the organization's training and development programs.Lastly, the CIO is responsible for the technical oversight of all AI models and algorithms in deployment. This will only be solved through a technical implementation that can monitor and ensure compliance is recorded of all the models deployed. If the organization has a Chief Data Officer, this responsibility may likely be best placed with this role.Continuous monitoring: As mentioned, ongoing monitoring becomes necessary immediately upon adoption in national legislation. And given the requirement to retain inventory and compliance of AI implementations, organizations will need to create a centralized repository of AI models and their behavior, ensuring that a record is kept of past activity for high-risk AI products and solutions. There is a complex twist to this. You will need to know whether AI environments that run outside the EU are used inside the EU and where the test data for the environment originated. For global organizations, this will pose an added complexity for their adoption of AI across their organizations. Continuous monitoring and compliance reporting are only achieved through a platform approach to AI models. Ensuring this overall monitoring and compliance requires collaboration between the Chief Legal Officer, the CIO, the head of Supply Chain, and the organization's product development function. Action: Organizations need to create a recording system to track and monitor AI products and solutions and their compliance. The senior leadership team will need to address AI regulation this year as an agenda item at a leadership team meeting. And the outcome of the meeting must be to assign accountability within the organization.The role of Purchasing: AI models will eventually be found in all software and data products, and likely many physical products purchased, such as a car or medical equipment. Consequently, the role of Purchasing in organizations becomes a point of record and monitoring of product certification (such as the CE certification of AI-enabled products). The purchasing organization will need to be ready to capture the requirements of the new rules in contracts. The purchasing organization will equally become the point at which AI models, products with embedded AI are recorded in the asset registry of the organization. This is the point at which tracking of AI implementations needs to start. Action: Empower Purchasing to capture AI products and solutions into the company and build this into the asset registry of the organization.Communication: Most AI solutions and products will fall into the categories of ''limited'' or ''minimal'' risk and will not require the same level of oversight as high-risk AI products and solutions. However, as the EU proposal also supports, proactive communication with the different stakeholders about the organization's AI principles, especially in the actual usage of AI-enabled systems and products, is advisable. As outlined in our note last year about AI communications, all organizations would be well advised in informing their key stakeholders about their approach to AI. The leadership should create communication for the three essential stakeholder constituencies, customers, employees, and suppliers. Once the regulation is in place across the EU, this should be standard practice for all organizations. In addition to the three constituencies, it would also become essential to ensure that AI ethics and risk are part of the product descriptions for organizations that produce physical products with embedded AI. Action: Implement and communicate an AI charter for each of the three critical stakeholders of the organization, customers, suppliers, and employees.The EU proposal for AI regulation is complex. The proposal has yet to be completed and a precise implementation timeline communicated. It will have to balance the need for regulation with the requirement to create an AI-competitive Europe. A point that critics of the recent document may point to is tilting too much towards regulation. However, what is clear is that this will become law in the EU. And as a result, this, no different from the GDPR, will require organizations to act. Organizations that act now will be better prepared from a regulatory perspective and highly likely to exploit the enormous business opportunities that AI delivers. This is a critical topic of action of CEOs in 2021.

        <h4>Six Questions U.S. Investors Should Ask SoftBank's CEO Son</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son will be in New York on Monday to pitch hedge funds and financial institutions on the merits of SoftBank Group Corp., in the first such meeting since the implosion of WeWork. Convincing investors the tide has turned will hinge on a handful of key questions. Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp. last month said it had taken a stake in SoftBank because the Japanese company's shares are woefully undervalued compared with its assets. At Monday's event, organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the billionaire is likely to point to the approved sale of Sprint Corp., a rally in Uber Technologies Inc. shares and Elliott's purchase of SoftBank stock as signs of changing fortunes. Son, 62, can speak for hours about artificial intelligence and SoftBank's role in the &quot;information revolution,&quot; but investors are likely to focus on more mundane topics. How Will He Respond to Elliott? Speaking at an earnings briefing on Feb. 13, Son called the New York-based activist investor an &quot;important partner&quot; and said he's in broad agreement with Elliott's arguments for buybacks and increasing the stock price. Son has signaled less receptiveness to Elliott's other suggestions: selling more of the stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and reining in the Vision Fund, a $100 billion investment vehicle that accounted for more than $10 billion of losses in the past two quarters. Son is personally handling interactions with Elliott, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, head of the Vision Fund Rajeev Misra, and SoftBank Group's Robert Townsend are also closely involved, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. The news of Elliott's stake, which people familiar with the matter have said is a nearly $3 billion, sent SoftBank's shares to the highest in a year, but have since retreated over 10%. It's not clear whether representatives from Elliott will be at the Monday event, which was scheduled before the activist investor disclosed its stake and is not designed to specifically address its involvement. Will He Fund a Big Buyback? Elliott has called for a buyback of as much as $20 billion, which would be several times SoftBank's biggest repurchase to date. The company's last buyback was its biggest at 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion). Announced in February 2019, it sparked a rally that pushed the stock to its highest price in about two decades. Selling Alibaba shares to pay for a buyback, as Elliott has proposed, could be a point of contention with Son. In the past, Son has used its stake as collateral to borrow money for big acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of chip designer ARM Holdings. Son said during SoftBank's latest quarterly financial briefing that he'd prefer to sell as little as possible and that there's &quot;no rush&quot; to do so. While Elliott and SoftBank have yet to discuss specific amounts, a buyback is an easy sell for Son, since one was already in the works before the activist's involvement, the person familiar said. SoftBank has also stoked expectations when it announced on Feb. 19 plans to borrow as much as 500 billion yen by putting up shares of its Japanese telecom unit as collateral. How Risky is SoftBank's Debt Load? The loan has raised questions about SoftBank's massive debt pile. SoftBank said the money will come from 16 financial institutions and pledged as much as 953 million shares of SoftBank Corp. as collateral. Overseas banks will provide the bulk of the margin loan, with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG contributing 68 billion yen each, the Nikkei reported. &quot;It's very worrisome that to raise just a few billion dollars of debt, Son had to go to a dozen banks. On top of that they had to put up collateral worth $15 billion,&quot; said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. &quot;It looks like Japanese banks are worried about concentration risks.&quot; SoftBank had 19.25 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of Dec. 31, a 23% increase since the start of the fiscal year in April. Sprint's imminent merger with T-Mobile will lighten the load by about 4.9 trillion yen. Still, SoftBank may find it a challenge to balance shareholder returns with big-ticket investments in technology companies. The company had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents, while more than 2.6 trillion yen of bonds are coming due in the next three years. What is the Vision Fund's Future? The Vision Fund is recovering from a series of stumbles. WeWork's plan to go public last year imploded, forcing SoftBank to arrange a rescue financing of $9.5 billion in October. Uber, despite a recent surge, is trading about 24% below last year's offering price. The fund has suffered other high-profile setbacks, including investments in failed online retailer Brandless Inc., dog-walking app Wag Labs Inc. and pizza robot company Zume Pizza Inc. Elliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review investment processes at the Vision Fund. It also argues the fund has dragged down the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under management, said people familiar with the discussions. Son himself has conceded that missteps with the original fund are making it difficult to raise money for a successor. He said in February that SoftBank may need to invest in startups using solely its own capital for a year or two. &quot;Vision Fund 1 companies will need more cash and many of them will not be able to get it at the same valuation, which means more losses for SoftBank,&quot; Jefferies' Goyal said. &quot;Without a second Vision Fund, how will these companies get funding?&quot; Will He Improve Governance? Some at SoftBank are resistant to the idea of an oversight committee. Instead, SoftBank is seeking to resolve issues at the Vision Fund with new governance standards for the companies it invests in. The new rules will encompass how the fund approaches the composition of the board of directors, founder and management rights, rights of shareholders, and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest. SoftBank recognized the need for more oversight as early as 2018, when it charged Claure with a broad review of operations across SoftBank companies. The COO, formerly the head of Sprint, spent months assembling a team of about 40 executives. In the end, he was forced to cede control of the so-called SoftBank Operating Group to Misra, the head of the fund it was supposed to be overseeing. Will He Support Rajeev Misra? The spat was only the latest in a string of internal conflicts centered on Misra, the veteran Wall Street trader who once ran the Deutsche Bank subprime team immortalized in &quot;The Big Short.&quot; News reports alleged that Misra masterminded attacks that led to the departures of SoftBank President Nikesh Arora and Alok Sama, a contender for Misra's position at the Vision Fund. The latest revelations in a Wall Street Journal story last week detailed an alleged smear campaign that included a $500,000 payment to a shadowy Italian businessman who had worked with private intelligence operatives and computer hackers, and attempts at sexual blackmail. &quot;If these allegations are true, Misra has damaged not only his own reputation, but that of SoftBank as a whole,&quot; Goyal said. &quot;Mr. Son will do well to address this ASAP.&quot; SoftBank's board of directors had previously completed a review of allegations about Arora and concluded the claims are without merit. The company also said that it is looking into latest details. &quot;Misra could be the sacrificial lamb,&quot; said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. &quot;Throwing him under the bus would certainly send a signal that things are changing.&quot; To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net,Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Giles Turner, Nate Lanxon ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan's government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict. They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant. The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It's one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow U.S. ally South Korea hosts the other - and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology. As the U.S.-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China's domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities. Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world's most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year, scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it's worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers. Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the U.S. to China, Europe and Japan. &quot;We're in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,&quot; said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. &quot;The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.&quot; At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the U.S. under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China's plans to become a world leader in chip production. Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of U.S. industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation. For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order, is the new front line. Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as its territory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s status as the world's largest contract chipmaker - a trend taking over the industry - the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China's enmity, and to its standoff with the U.S. TSMC has become &quot;turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,&quot; founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building &quot;fabs&quot; in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world - chips that are no longer available to China's Huawei Technologies due to U.S. export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC's second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales, those shipments stopped in September. The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China's largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing's biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The U.S. is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China. China's intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the U.S. administration's efforts. &quot;They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,&quot; the official said. After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the U.S. One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said. China &quot;firmly opposes the unjustified suppression&quot; of its companies by the U.S. &quot;under the weakest pretext of national security,&quot; and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September. China - the world's biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold - isn't standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing's sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China's five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What's more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the U.S., with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production. Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven't just hit China's chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there's scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the U.S. election in November. Citing the need to promote &quot;digital sovereignty,&quot; the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe's share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now. Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company's thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy. Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries' tensions over Japan's wartime past. While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, &quot;there's no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,&quot; said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. &quot;Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.&quot; In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019. Pompeo had a message for them: China's Communist Party &quot;is a threat to your companies because they don't want to compete, they want to put you out of business,&quot; Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29. Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the U.S. line of sight. Israel - a high-tech R&amp;D hub where Intel is the largest private employer - exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows. That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel's Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there's a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future U.S. deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the U.S. is bound to &quot;start asking more questions.&quot; The U.K. is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set - the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software - underlies everything from smartphones to the world's fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company's takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would fall under American jurisdiction and become even more subject to U.S. export controls. While the U.K. government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn't normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal's implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the U.S. and China. Losing a world-class technology company to the U.S. for the Department of Justice to &quot;weaponize&quot; is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a U.K. strategic asset becomes &quot;recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal&quot; in its campaign against China. Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing's progress. &quot;The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,&quot; said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones. China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That's something President Xi Jinping is determined to end. Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors - circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates. Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won't necessarily guarantee success. The consensus is it won't be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China's high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the U.S.? To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA's Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval. The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer. Complete decoupling would harm U.S. competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&amp;D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. &quot;A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.&quot; ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Is it time to create an AI Guild in your organization?</h4>
        <div>
          To develop skills and competencies around AI and data analysis organizations need to make Ai, data and data science attractive to everyone. A way of doing this could be by creating an AI Guild.Usage of AI in many organizations often fails to scale because too few people across the organization understand AI from a business context.Developing skills and competencies around AI, data analysis, and data science among all employees is a challenge for most organizations but is vital to complete digitalization. And given the limited external experience, hiring these skills or competencies is equally challenging.Organizations will need a jolt to the system. They need to make AI, data, and data science attractive for everyone to develop.An AI GuildThese concerns led to the idea that perhaps organizations should create an AI Guild. An AI Guild would recruit members from among all the employees in your organization.The purpose of the AI Guild would be to increase the members' AI and data science skills and promote the personal benefits of understanding AI, data, and data science.Medieval guilds maintained a tight grip on who could be members of the guild but would ensure shared skills, tools, and knowledge.A modern AI Guild created within an organization must ensure that membership could encompass the entire employee base. And then focus on developing the skills of the members in collaboration with the members.In a couple of large organizations, we have recently worked with, an AI Guild has had a tremendous impact on AI and data competencies uptake, including attendance in training programs. This created a significant improvement in corporate AI competency as a result of creating an AI Guild.Why create itBut why create an AI Guild? Why not just have HR continue to be responsible for employee learning &amp; development, including AI, data analytics, and data science competencies?First, this approach, while plausible, will be too slow compared with the required competitive benefit of a rapid improvement in organizational competencies around AI and data through a guild approach.Second, the guild is run by the members, in this case, all the employees. That will usually result in higher engagement levels, which will be critical if the organization is to see a broad and rapid improvement in AI and data competencies. HR can and should be involved in sponsoring an AI Guild but not running it as an L&amp;D initiative.Employee-driven approachWhat benefits would result from creating an AI Guild?The first would be to create an employee-driven approach to increasing a set of skills that will become critical for all employees over the next few years and define all organizations' competitiveness. An employee-driven approach would likely ensure a significant adoption rate and more rapid retention of skills because it was driven by the individual, not a top-down exercise.The second benefit of an AI guild would be to demystify AI and data science, making them both understood and valued across the organizations. The result of demystifying AI would be that the organization would become more innovative in using data and AI. Demystifying AI and data would also result in more AI advocates across the organization.The third benefit would be to bring about a more natural and employee-involved approach to understanding AI ethics, risk, and governance. These three topics will become critical for organizations to have a broad knowledge of, and an AI Guild could most certainly be a vehicle for generating this understanding.Lastly, an AI Guild would act as an enabler for the transition of skills, tasks, and jobs in the organization over the next ten years. AI will change jobs, and the AI Guild would guide all employees on adapting and developing the required new and change skills for the future organization.Combining strategy and the employees' interestsSuccess for any broad organizational initiative, including improvement in skills, is only achieved if there is a positive symbiotic relationship between its strategy, including the executive team's objectives, and the employees'interests and aspirations.If the organization's strategy includes data and AI at the core of its future, then an AI Guild would provide a solution to get employees involved and invested in developing their skills. And by developing the AI, data, and data science competencies of all employees, the organization will significantly improve its chances of success.It may still entail that the HR organization sponsors and invests money in the AI Guild even if they don't run it. Several executives across the organization can equally become ambassadors for the AI Guild because their success is dependent on broad AI and data competencies. One such prominent executive will be the CIO.Lastly, the one true evangelist for an AI Guild (or any approach to improve AI and data literacy) has to be the CEO. Most organizations will not survive the next ten years unless they massively improve employee (and leadership) AI and data literacy, and the CEO will be responsible for just that.In this next phase of digitalization, making data and AI the core of the transformation will be critical. That transformation will only be successful if all employees are engaged and have the required future skills and competencies. An AI Guild with broad employee representation would be a critical vehicle in a successful transformation.

        <h4>Where Is the Inequality Problem?</h4>
        <div>
          Reading Thomas Piketty 's influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings. That is odd, because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book, Angus Deaton's The Great Escape (which I recently reviewed ), that the world is more equal than ever.Which view is right? The answer depends on whether one looks only at countries individually or at the world as a whole.The overarching fact in Deaton's book is that over the last few decades, several billion people in the developing world, particularly in Asia, have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty. The same machine that has increased inequality in rich countries has leveled the playing field globally for billions. Looking from afar, and giving, say, an Indian the same weight as an American or a Frenchman, the last 30 years have been among the greatest in human history for improving the lot of the poor.Piketty's brilliant book documents within-country inequality, with the main focus being on the rich world. Much of the cultural groundswell surrounding his book has come from people who view themselves as middle class within their own countries, but who are upper middle class or even rich by global standards.There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez. But I find their results persuasive, especially given that other authors, using completely different methods, have reached similar conclusions. Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis of the University of Chicago, for example, argue that labor's share of GDP has been declining globally since the 1970's.However, Piketty and Saez do not really offer a model, nor does this new book. And the lack of a model, combined with a focus on the world's upper-middle-class countries, matters a lot when it comes to policy prescriptions. Would Piketty's followers be nearly as enthusiastic about his proposed progressive global wealth tax if it were aimed at correcting the huge disparities between the richest countries and the poorest, instead of between those who are well off by global standards and the ultra-wealthy?Piketty argues that capitalism is unfair. Wasn't colonialism unfair, too? In any event, the idea of a global wealth tax is replete with credibility and enforcement problems, aside from being politically implausible.Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades, he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes. For example, if the main driver is the massive influx of Asian labor into globalized trade markets, the growth model put forth by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow suggests that eventually capital stocks will adjust and the wage rate will rise. Retirements from an aging labor force will eventually drive up wages as well. If , on the other hand, labor's share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation, downward pressures on that share will continue, as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago.Fortunately, there are much better ways to address rich-country inequality while still fostering long-term growth in demand for products from developing countries. For example, a shift to a relatively flat consumption tax (with a large deductible for progressivity) would be a far simpler and more effective way to tax past wealth accumulation, especially if citizens' tax home can be linked to the locale where their income was earned.A progressive consumption tax is relatively efficient and does not distort savings decisions as much as today's income taxes do. Why try to move to an improbable global wealth tax when alternatives are available that are growth friendly, raise significant revenue, and can be made progressive through a very high exemption.In addition to a global wealth tax, Piketty recommends an 80% marginal tax rate on income for the United States. Though I strongly believe that the US needs more progressive taxation, particularly of the top 0.1%, I don't understand why he assumes that an 80% rate would not cause significant distortions, especially as this assumption contradicts a large body of work by the Nobel laureates Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott.There are many practical policies that can be adopted to reduce inequality, in addition to a progressive consumption tax. Focusing on the US, Jeffery Frankel of Harvard University has suggested the elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers, a cut in deductions for high-income workers, and higher inheritance taxes. Universal pre-school education would enhance long-term growth, as would a much greater emphasis on lifetime adult education (my addition), possibly via online courses. Carbon taxes would help mitigate global warming while raising considerable revenues.In accepting Piketty's premise that inequality matters more than growth, one needs to remember that many developing-country citizens rely on rich-country growth to help them escape poverty. The first problem of the twenty-first century remains to help the dire poor in Africa and elsewhere. By all means, the elite 0.1% should pay much more in taxes, but let us not forget that when it comes to reducing global inequality, the capitalist system has had an impressive three decades.Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief economist of the IMF , is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014.

        <h4>The U.S. Gets Serious About Catching Up to China in R&amp;D</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a few years now, commentators (including myself) have been calling for a big boost in research spending by the U.S. federal government. In their book &quot;Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream,&quot; economists Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson called for devoting $100 billion a year to develop a network of new research centers around the country. A team at the Brookings Institution came up with a more modest but still substantial plan for $10 billion a year, funneled through universities. Big ideas like this often tend to languish for years or decades before legislators decide to take a stab at implementing them - if they ever do. In this era of partisan posturing, that seems especially likely to happen. But amazingly, a bipartisan group of legislators is acting on the idea of major new research spending. The Endless Frontier Act would spend more than $20 billion a year on upgrading the National Science Foundation, to be renamed the National Science and Technology Foundation, with greatly expanded missions, powers and facilities. Drawing on plans like those of Brookings and Gruber and Johnson, the agency's new technology directorate would create a series of research centers, based at existing universities, focusing on 10 key areas of technology. This is a great move because leveraging existing universities will yield much more bang for the buck than trying to build new research parks. It will also help preserve research universities and the college towns around them. For the past few decades, universities have counted on increasing tuition to fund faculty salaries, graduate-student stipends, new research facilities and other research inputs. But enrollment of high-paying foreign students and state university funding both probably are in long-term decline. So federal funding needs to step in to sustain the research that in turn sustains both U.S. technological leadership and regional economies. One thing that's encouraging is that the Endless Frontier Act also budgets $2 billion a year for creating technology hubs in economically distressed regions (though it's not clear yet what form those hubs would take). The new bill also recognizes that simply throwing money at research problems isn't always the best way to make progress. Many of the key government-funded innovations over the past few decades, including the internet itself, have come from the legendary Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA uses a unique model for organizing research projects: giving free rein to powerful program directors, pulling in researchers from across different institutions and fields, and focusing on specific goals. The technology directorate of the proposed NSTF would have the ability to organize DARPA-like projects in addition to traditional research efforts. If enacted, the Endless Frontier Act would help revitalize the U.S. economy at the national and regional levels and preserve institutions of higher education. But it has one more important goal: keeping the U.S. ahead of its new rival China in the emerging technology race. The U.S. cannot maintain its technological lead simply by kneecapping China with export restrictions or by putting a halt to Chinese espionage, it also needs to invest vigorously in its own capabilities, just as China has done. Big investments in research were one of the key ways that the U.S. won the original Cold War against the Soviet Union, and this contest will be no different. Many of the areas of research named in the act are either things China has invested aggressively in or things that would help U.S. industry stay ahead of Chinese competition - artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, biotechnology and so on. There are two possible concerns about the plan. First, even with more than $20 billion a year, it isn't enough to restore U.S. technological leadership - at least, not if the Cold War is any guide. Federal research spending has declined from 1.2% of gross domestic product to only 0.8% since the late 1980s, and $20 billion is only 0.1% of GDP. Ideally, the Endless Frontier Act will be only the start. The initial spending, although substantial, will actually be a proof of concept that can be scaled up later once the new directorate is created and researchers learn how to put the new flows of money to productive use. Second, some scientists worry that a greater focus on technology and mission-oriented, DARPA-style research will detract from the NSF's traditional pursuit of basic research. But this probably isn't something worth agonizing over. The Endless Frontier Act would actually boost the budgets of the NSF's existing science directorates, which work on basic research and traditional approaches. Investing in applicable technologies and mission-oriented projects is a complement to traditional basic research, not a substitute. In fact, accidental discoveries made by scientists working on applied technologies can even create new directions for fundamental research. A big push for federal research spending is one of the most obvious things the U.S. government could do to both benefit the U.S. economy and restore U.S. tech dominance. This bipartisan plan is a very encouraging sign that the U.S. isn't content to slip grumpily into decline.

        <h4>China Pledges Quality Growth, Tech Powerhouse in Five-Year Plan</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- China unveiled the first glimpses of its economic plans for the next five years, promising to build the nation into a technological powerhouse as it emphasized quality growth over speed. Initial details released by the Communist Party's Central Committee Thursday stressed the need for sustainable growth and also pledged to develop a robust domestic market. The communique released by state media following a four-day closed-door meeting didn't specify the pace of growth policy makers would target. The statement elevated China's self-reliance in technology into a national strategic pillar, a move signaled by officials from President Xi Jinping down in the lead the meeting. Central to that endeavor is self-reliance in chips, the building blocks for innovations from artificial intelligence to fifth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles. Beijing's efforts are gaining urgency as the U.S. seeks to contain the rise of its geopolitical rival. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., barred dozens of China's largest tech companies from buying American parts, and even slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat. Read More: The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier Unlike the last five-year plan, which sought to achieve &quot;medium-to-high growth&quot; in order to build a &quot;moderately prosperous society,&quot; this plenum had been expected to focus on the quality rather than the pace of growth. In Thursday's statement, officials pledged to stick to a strategy of boosting domestic demand and opening up the economy over the next five years. Even though the plan doesn't mention a specific rate of growth for gross domestic product, the government remains ambitious in its outlook. &quot;The leadership still expects the size of the economy, household income as well as GDP per capita to reach a 'new milestone' by 2035,&quot; said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. &quot;China did not abandon GDP targeting, it's just expressed in a more subtle way.&quot; While the strategy on &quot;dual circulation&quot; was mentioned twice in the communique, there wasn't any specific explanation or details of what it entails. The nation needs to &quot;smooth the domestic circulation, facilitate dual circulation at home and abroad, comprehensively promote consumption and expand room for investment,&quot; according to the statement. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Jack Ma Becomes Richer Than Walmart Heirs With Mega Ant IPO</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma, the former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with $60,000, is poised to become the world's 11th richest person after Ant Group Co. priced shares for a record initial public offering. Ma's 8.8% stake is worth $27.4 billion based on the stock pricing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That will take the 56-year-old's fortune to $71.1 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, exceeding that of Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, L'Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and individual members of the Waltons, whose family owns Walmart Inc. Ant's mammoth listing is poised to boost the fortunes of a group of early investors and employees. The company has granted staff share-based awards since 2014 and at least 18 other people have become billionaires from the IPO. Lucy Peng, a director at the payments giant through August, is the biggest individual Ant owner after Ma, and has a $5.2 billion stake. Chairman Eric Jing's holding is worth $3.1 billion. WATCH: Jack Ma's fortune is set to surge to $71.1 billion, above Oracle's Larry Ellison and individual members of the the Walton family. Source: Bloomberg) Ant is set to raise almost $35 billion, beating Saudi Aramco's $29 billion sale last year. The Shanghai stock priced at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) apiece and its Hong Kong shares at HK$80 ($10.32) each. The company could raise another $5.2 billion if it exercises its green shoe options, taking its market value to about $320 billion. That would be more than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and four times bigger than Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The big winners of the listing own their stakes through two limited partnerships registered in Hangzhou that together hold about 40% of Ant. Alibaba, in turn, has a third of the fintech firm. Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing, the family behind a French supermarket giant, the son of a Taiwanese real estate billionaire and Chinese retail tycoon Shen Guojun are among the other owners who have invested in the company over the year. Jack Ma Photographer: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg Ant began when Alibaba launched the Alipay payments app in 2004 as an escrow service for buyers and sellers on Ma's e-commerce website. In 2013, they were given the ability to save money and earn interest on the balances stored on their accounts. The firm then started offering credit to small businesses, branching out from its consumer-finance focus, and eventually expanded to services such as block chain, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Since co-founding Alibaba with Ma, Peng served in different roles. She set up Alibaba's human-resources department and, after helping create Ant, was its chief executive officer until Jing took over in 2016. Two years later, he succeeded her as executive chairman of the fintech company. Both Peng and Jing are members of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36-person group with the power to determine the annual cash bonuses for all members of management.

        <h4>Ford Elevating Farley to CEO After Hackett's Bid Falls Short</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said it will promote Jim Farley to chief executive officer on Oct. 1 to replace Jim Hackett, who has elected to retire after his three-year bid to turn around the automaker failed to gain traction. Farley, 58, became chief operating officer in March when his main internal rival was ousted following the botched launch of the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford's stock was routed under Hackett, 65, before the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the second-largest U.S. automaker's woes. Ford shares climbed as much as 3.3% during regular trading Tuesday. The stock had dropped almost 40% during Hackett's tenure through Monday's close. Read more: Ford's Stock Slump Under Hackett Exceeds Predecessor's Rout Last week, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss that was less than half the $5 billion deficit it had predicted, due in part to demand for its SUVs and trucks holding up better than feared. But some of the company's over-performance also could be chalked an on-paper gain from its investment in self-driving startup Argo AI. &quot;The wind in our sails is really starting to pick up, and Jim had a big, big role in that,&quot; Hackett said of Farley on a call with reporters. &quot;I can confident that the things I was asked to do have actually started taking root.&quot; Botched Explorer The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 outbreak hit Ford two years into an $11 billion restructuring that Hackett drew navigate the company out of a long slump. He saw the need to update a lineup that had gotten stale under his predecessor, Mark Fields, with greater connectivity features and electrified powertrains, and pulled Ford out of passenger-car segments in North America. But the first of those major redesigns, the Explorer, went horribly awry. The Chicago plant that underwent a major overhaul to build the revised SUV was plagued by personnel problems and struggled to get the vehicle out the door. Thousands were shipped to a Michigan factory hundreds of miles away for rework. In February, Ford announced the promotion of Farley, one of the two presidents seen as leading candidates to become the next CEO. The other, Joe Hinrichs, left the company. 'Smooth Transition' Farley will take over as Ford prepares to roll out three crucial new models aimed at reversing its fortunes: the electric Mustang Mach-E, the revived Bronco SUV and a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 pickup, its most profitable model. He promised to &quot;swing for the fences&quot; as Ford's leader, vowing to return the automaker to 10% profit margin in North America -- its long-standing goal -- and to have flawless launches of new models. &quot;We know our competition today is Amazon, Baidu, Tesla, Apple, Toyota, and others,&quot; Farley said. &quot;They're well-financed and voracious companies.&quot; Ford likely will seek to restore the dividend Hackett was forced to suspend in March when the coronavirus pandemic upended economies worldwide. Management had previously said the payout was sacrosanct, and cutting it off tested the faith of the founding family that had supported the CEO. Ford also lost its investment-grade credit ratings. &quot;Nothing makes me happier than having a smooth transition,&quot; Executive Chairman Bill Ford said during the call. &quot;This is something that we've been planning for some time. And it seemed liked the right time coming out of the second quarter when we performed much better than the world thought we would.&quot; (Updates with CEO's comment in the fifth paragraph.) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Samsung Details Plans for $17 Billion Chip Facility in U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. revealed additional details about its plans to build a cutting-edge semiconductor facility in the U.S. in a filing with the Texas government, making the disclosure asthe Biden administration vows to make the security of the U.S. chip supply a national priority.The South Korean company plans to invest about $17 billion in its Project Silicon Silver and create about 1,800 jobs over the first ten years, according to an economic impact study prepared by a local consultant. Some $5.1 billion would go into buildings and property improvements, while $9.9 billion would be spent on machinery and equipment.The filing with the Texas comptroller warned the chips project is ''highly competitive.'' Samsung is evaluating alternatives sites in Arizona and New York, as well as in Korea.''Because of its strong ties to the local community and the successful past 25 years of manufacturing in Texas, Samsung Austin Semiconductor would like to continue to invest in the city and the state,'' the study said.Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Core of U.S.-China Policy (1)In their first weeks in office, Joe Biden's administration has emphasized the importance of advanced technologies, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks. The president has ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths.Bloomberg News first reported in January that Samsung was considering building an advanced chipmaking plant in the U.S., in hopes of winning more American clients and narrowing the gap with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company was in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Details of Samsung's discussions with local governments have since leaked out in filings and other revelations. The economic impact study was prepared by Impact DataSource LLC, an Austin, Texas-based economic consulting, research and analysis firm.The report shows Samsung's Project Silicon Silver would add approximately 7 million square feet of new space to the Austin campus, where the company has had operations for decades. It estimates that 542 new workers would move to the city, contributing to an addition of 1,626 new residents.Property tax abatements would total about $1.5 billion over 20 years at the city and county levels, while direct and indirect economic output would be about $8.6 billion and salaries would total $7.3 billion.A January filing detailed the likely timeline for the project. If Samsung chooses Austin, it would break ground in the second quarter of 2021 with the expectation that production would be up and running by the fourth quarter of 2023, it said.Separately, Samsung's current foundry plant in Austin hasn't resumed operations since Feb. 16 after it was ordered to halt operations by Austin Energy due to blackouts in the region. Power and water are back but it will take more time to fully restart operations, officials said.(Updates with timeline for project in penultimate paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>My End-to-End Process for Data Science Projects</h4>
        <div>
          Why do I write this story? Simply because not every data science project is successful. For sure, you can Google this topic and you will find thousands of reasons. For me, projects that didn't succeed have been the biggest opportunities to improve my process and my skills. In this story, I will briefly summarize my learnings by providing my current (and still improving) process in a data science project. I do not doubt that this process does not apply to everyone simply because there is not a single definition of a &quot;data science project&quot;. My aim here is to share my experience by summarizing the different steps of a project. It does not guarantee success, but, at least, this process will try to address all pitfalls that you, as a Data Scientist, can prevent. My role is to create pipelines that consume data and provide insight(s) (see my definition of pipeline in my previous story ). This is the process I am using to do so. Scope the solution The first step is to scope the solution. Sometimes it is very hard to find the balance between expectations and pricing. My recommendation is to drive any decisions by looking at the real need. This would allow putting aside &quot;nice to have&quot; s and prioritize &quot;mandatory features&quot;. Start with &quot;why?&quot; (ref: Simon Sinek) To draft the scope of the project, the first step is to work with the client and to understand the pain point and his motivations. In this story, I will use the term client for the person paying for the project. In reality, the client might be a director/VP/CTO of your company. The client is the one that decided to invest in this project. It is mandatory to understand why this person is interested in this project. Maximizing production? Scaling of a process? Avoid failures in his factory? Anything What is the pain point? This is very important for the next step. A good trick is to ask how the client is currently treating his pain point. If there is already a metric capturing the efficiency of the current process. Who will use it? Many times I had the opportunity to draft a scope without even knowing who will use the solution. This is wrong! A project is successful if the solution is used. I have been in projects where the user is not even clearly identified. This is the best way to create something that will never be used. A CEO of a company says: &quot;AI is trendy and cool, we should do something with it&quot;. RUN! Let's take an example. A director/VP wants to use AI to optimize stock management in his factory. Great! Then I started talking about the solution but the future user is not even in the room. We start working on the project and we decided that the algorithm will provide an email every morning with a forecast of demand to help the stock manager to make the best decision. I work hard and I succeed in this task. We even develop the infrastructure to support the algorithm. Everything is done and the CEO is happy! Well, guess what? This forecast is not even the manager's biggest concern. He has a hard time figuring out in real-time where and what items are available in the factory. Too bad, a simple interactive dashboard would have done the job. The forecast is useless without this information. The project is a failure. In another situation, the manager needs a forecast every week and not every day, or the forecast needs to be available in realtime not per day All those situations happen. My best recommendation is to bring the future user as early as you can in the conversation because he is the best person to define the needs What? At this point, what I want is a clear success criterion. Client: &quot;I need the algorithm to predict when my assembly line will fail&quot;. Me: &quot;Ok&quot;, me looking at the operator, &quot;How much in advance do you need this prediction?&quot; (Here, I am trying to define the granularity of the problem.) Operator: &quot;I need the prediction for 2 days in advance, and I need this information in the morning before 7 am&quot;. Me: &quot;Great, but you have to understand that chances are the algorithm will produce false alarms and also miss some failures. Are you comfortable with this? What is the current situation? How much cost failure and how much cost asking the maintenance team to work on a machine if it is not needed? How many machines you can check within a day?&quot; I need all those answers to create a success criterion. Me: &quot;How do you solve this problem right now?&quot;. Operator: &quot;We have 1000 machines and we have at least 1 of them would fail every day. We cannot check them all, so, we prioritize our investigation by checking the one that has not been checked for a long time&quot;. The last information is very important because it tells me where is the bar. If I simulate the current strategy, I can evaluate how much better my solution is. All this information helps me to define a metric with a success criterion. In this type of situation, I rather use a metric like a Hit Rate. The number of true positives within the top N most probable predicted failures. N is the number of interventions the maintenance team can take care of within a day. I rarely communicate metrics like F-Measure or AUC to the client because he cannot use this measurement to decide if the solution is a success or not. At the end of the conversation, we found out that a Hit Rate of 2 would be valuable enough for the solution to be used. Also, thanks to the information I collected, I can price how much money the client is currently wasting and how much money the client can save with a successful solution. Then, I can convert my metric in dollars when I present progress to the client. An important consideration is that my solution will be integrated into an existing system. This system exists for a reason and people are using it. The AI solution will alter this system. This disruption has to be anticipated otherwise the final phase of the project (when people use the solution) may cause unexpected additional costs. This disruption might be so important that the client might finally change his mind and refuse to take the risk of releasing the solution (it happened to me). My recommendation is to introduce this potential disruption in the conversation during the initial scoping of the solution. At the end of the discussion, I ask for a snippet of data, some information about the way we can collect the data, etc I do data analysis (1-2 days) to check if there are no big red flags. Data engineers would also take part in the conversation to draft an architecture. Now, I have the scope, I can move to the next step which is working on the solution. The Proof Of Concept (POC) phase The objective of this phase is to demonstrate that the project is viable and can bring value. To optimize the process in this phase, you have to consider what needs to be constraints. Basically in a POC phase, I cannot constraint the time, the resources, and the accuracy at the same time. Time means the amount of time I can spend on this project. Resources are the number of persons allocated to this project. Accuracy means the accuracy of the model. Theoretically, you can only constraints two of them. In reality, resources are more or less always constrained. Maybe some companies can allocate an &quot;infinite&quot; number of resources on a project. I have never been in such a situation. If you relax accuracy, it corresponds to a &quot;hackathon mode&quot; or &quot;spike&quot;. It is useful when you want to investigate an idea, most probably, for a short time. The most realistic choice is to relax time. Some clients have a hard time working in this mode because they have deadlines to respect and they might have the feeling that the POC will never end. But, the trick is to communicate progress to the client in an efficient way. For that reason, I use the Agile methodology. This paradigm has been invented for software development but I adapt it in the context of a data science project. If you are not familiar with the wording, I invite you to read some articles about Agile. Sprint 1: I work generally in a sprint of 2 or 3 weeks depending on the client. The objective of the first sprint is to establish a baseline. A baseline is declared when the first end-to-end pipeline (from data to metric) delivers a number. In this initial sprint, I choose the simplest path. This is the only thing that matters. Get a number as fast as possible. For instance, if some variables have missing values, the simplest is to remove those variables from the dataset. Or if I have to choose a model, the simplest is a linear regression or a logistic regression because there is no parametrization. No creasy preprocessing, only simple steps. Avoid any type of step that would imply fine-tuning or calibration. No PCA, no standardization, nothing. Basically, in this sprint, I set up the CI/CD, the git repository, I write a parser, and I create the simplest version of the pipeline to end up with a number for the metric. The only thing that I need to pay attention to is the evaluation strategy. It is hard to compare performances between 2 pipelines if you switch between 66% train 33% test procedure to a cross-validation procedure. The evaluation strategy needs to be as close as possible from the way the pipeline will be used. In the above example, I would use a growing window for the training set and a sliding window for the test set. Sprint 2: The second sprint is to productize the baseline. With the help of data engineers and DevOps, we set up the architecture to support the pipeline. Some people prefer to wait until the pipeline reaches the level of accuracy as it is defined in the scope. For me, I try to unblock the other teams as early as I can to produce an MVP as soon as possible. For my sprints, I use standard cycles. A stand up meeting every day to check if there are no blockers. We do planning at the beginning of the sprint and demo at the end. We also do retrospective from time to time. At the end of the sprint, we check if the new version of the pipeline provides better results compared to the baseline. If yes, it corresponds to the new baseline for the next sprint. I track this information over sprints and I include it in the demo. I show the plot above to the client during the demo. He can decide 1) to continue for another sprint, 2) to declare that we reach the objectives or 3) to drop the project because the current solution is too far from the expectations and it would take a prohibitive amount of time to finish. This early stoping is beneficial for everyone. For the client, he is not wasting money on a project that might be too expensive and for the team to be reallocated to another project with a higher probability of success. The demo is also the opportunity to validate new assumptions. During each iteration, I increase the complexity of the pipeline. For instance, I gather external data to augment the dataset, I improve the preprocessing, add more features, use a different algorithm, etc The danger here is to over-engineer the pipeline. For instance, I don't try to draft a new deep learning architecture at the second iteration or I don't add crazy complex features to nail one or two outliers that would not affect the metric drastically. To identify what can be the most impactful alteration of the pipeline, I often look at instances that have the largest error to try to find an explanation and derive a new cleaning strategy and/or new features. I order those alterations by the amount of work and start with the simplest. A note about CI/CD and notebook: A measurement of the metric has to be reproducible. So I disregard any data point that has not been produced by the CI/CD pipeline. If the result has been obtained in a Jupyter notebook, I have to convince myself that it can be reproduced on another machine. Notebooks are cool for data analysis but they require strong discipline to make sure the results are reproducible. I know I am not capable of such a thing. For that reason, I only trust numbers from the CI/CD. I have been in a situation where I claimed to the client that we meet the expectation and finally, I was not able to reproduce the results. It is very frustrating and costly for everyone I wish you never have to live in this situation. Productization I strongly recommend you have a look at the article &quot; Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems &quot;. The machine learning code is a small piece of the entire solution. It is important to have a clear picture of the additional steps needed for productization. productization requires the support of data engineers and DevOps. Hopefully, the POC is done and we met the success criterion. Good!! Now we need to productize the pipeline. There are two main ways to proceed: Hands-off . The results of the POC are translated into specifications. A team of software developers take over, rewrite the entire code, and productize the pipeline. Push to prod . My code is reused &quot;as is&quot; and with the help of data engineers and DevOps, we build an infrastructure around it. Both approaches have pros and cons. The hands-off approach will make sure that the solution is more stable. Because a data scientist is not always an experimented developer (no offense here), productization of the code is often in the hand of other people. It is often the case in a large company. A detail, in this situation, the ownership of the code does not belong to the data scientist anymore. So fixing bugs is done by the software development team. The second approach is to ask the data scientist to wrap his code into a library and it will be used in another system. For instance, in a lambda function in the cloud. This approach is faster since we avoid rewriting code. The code is &quot;cleaned&quot; and the debts are paid. If you follow my recommendations in my previous story , this step can be done efficiently. Finally, the owner of the code remains the data scientist and I am in charge of fixing bugs. This way is often chosen in small companies and startups where a limited number of people can work on each project. I prefer to use the second option. I will explain my reason with more detail in the next section. Briefly, when using the first approach, if I want to release improvements of the solution or to add some features, I would have to work on my code base, rewrite specifications, wait for the developer team to update the solution, etc This can take months. A fast cycle would imply to minimize hands-off. Maintaining and improving the pipeline Ok, now my pipeline is in production. However, it is important to create a process to capture the feedback of the operator to continuously improve the solution. For instance, The operator is using the product daily but he proposed some improvements for the algorithm. For instance, instead of predicting if a failure would occur, he prefers to have a score or a probability of failure. To derive a score from the prediction, it would require a minor change in the pipeline. Just returning the probability instead of the predicted class. What I try to do is to set up a feedback process as soon as the first version of the pipeline is accessible (sprint 2-3). This feedback loop would also help me to adjust over the sprints but when the product is released, this continuous improvement remains. To have a good interaction with the user, I want improvement to be released as fast as possible. For that reason, I avoid the hands-off strategy to do the improvement myself and get feedback faster. The feedback loop is also important to capture the decisions made by the operator. When decisions don't match the prediction of the pipelines, it means we can improve the pipeline by incorporating the &quot;reasons&quot; the operator took his decision. Over time, the role of the operator will change and get simpler. One consequence is the ability to scale his capabilities. Ultimately, a predictive pipeline can become a prescriptive pipeline. Then, the prediction is not interpreted by the operator anymore and directly connected to take action. This introduces my last point: Company reorganization It is important to understand that introducing an AI solution in a company, will disrupt the usual way the employee would work. Sometimes, the employees' role changes and additional skills might be needed. For example, if you introduce a chatbot to help the customer support team, this team might be reduced or reallocated to other tasks. The solution might also cause some business reorientation in the client company. I have seen some companies changing their strategy from selling products to selling services because of the new solution. This is often not anticipated by the client. Sometimes, it can cause the project to stop for a while. It happened to me that the company would have been so much affected by the algorithm that the reorganization and the integration of the solution in their system would require much more investment. They finally decided not to use it. I try to introduce this subject very early in the process to make sure the client would anticipate the situation. Please feel free to connect.

        <h4>Demant A/S: Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids</h4>
        <div>
          30.11.2020 07:59:36 CET | Demant A/S |
    Investor NewsInvestor news30 November 2020 Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids  Greater Copenhagen, Denmark - Today, Demant, a global leader in hearing healthcare, is announcing the launch of new groundbreaking hearing aid technology in all its four hearing aid brands, Oticon, Philips Hearing Solutions, Bernafon and Sonic. The launch of new innovative hearing solutions strongly supports Demants purpose of delivering life-changing hearing health to people living with hearing loss. The new products will be launched in all major markets in the coming months and support millions of people in enjoying life to the fullest. Oticon is launching the new, revolutionary Oticon More, which is the worlds first hearing aid that allows users to hear all relevant sounds thanks to an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More is powered by an entirely new chipset, PolarisTM, boasting an eightfold increase in memory and twice the processing power compared to the previous generation, Velox STM. The all-new Polaris platform features seven processing cores, and due to its unique architecture, the 28 nanometer chipset delivers superior processing capabilities while optimising power consumption. Through years of innovation, research and collaboration with leading research institutions around the world, Oticon has built unique knowledge and understanding of how the brain perceives sound. Contrary to common belief, it is now established that the brain needs access to all sounds in the environment to function optimally. By applying this knowledge to hearing technology, we enable the hearing aid users to enjoy more complete sound landscapes and simply get more out of life when they use our products, says Søren Nielsen, President and CEO of Demant. In 2016, Oticon presented a paradigm shift in hearing care with Oticon OpnTM, which, for the first time ever, allowed users to get access to all speakers in the sound landscape to allow for better understanding and participation. This groundbreaking approach is fundamentally different from what traditional hearing aids do, as they apply directionality and only focus on the speaker in front, while suppressing all other sounds. Then, in 2019, the paradigm was further developed with the breakthrough feedback prevention system of Oticon Opn STM. With Oticon More, Oticon is now taking the next big step on its BrainHearingTM journey by introducing the worlds first purpose-built hearing aid platform with an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More utilises the intelligent capabilities of a Deep Neural Network to mimic the way the brain functions. It handles sounds based on the experience and training it has received. The Deep Neural Network in Oticon More is so much more than standard AI software - it is a unique and dedicated hearing aid solution, developed for real-time operation in everyday life. Based on our vast sound processing experience, we have trained the Deep Neural Network with 12 million sound scenes from real life. This optimises the way Oticon More makes sounds more distinct by working seamlessly across varying listening environments with unparalleled precision and clarity, while ensuring that the sound is comfortable for the user. With this integrated intelligence, Oticon More has learned to recognise all types of sounds, their details, and how they should ideally sound to optimally support the brain. As a result, Oticon More delivers 30% more information to the brain than Oticon Opn S, while reducing the listening effort of the user and improving speech understanding by 15%. Delivering breakthrough innovation and hearing care that improve the lives of people with hearing loss is what we are all about at Demant. It makes me proud that we are ready to launch the next generation of hearing aids that use deep learning, the most powerful of the AI techniques, to optimise hearing aid performance. Not only does it improve the brains hearing function, it also enables users to hear more with less effort, so they can enjoy and keep taking part in everyday life, says Søren Nielsen, President &amp; CEO of Demant. In addition to superior audiological performance, Oticon More features state-of-the-art direct streaming from both iOS and compatible Android devices using the ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) protocol and is prepared for the next generation of connectivity based on the upcoming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. This new, groundbreaking innovation from Oticon will be available in a miniRITE rechargeable style, in three upper price points and at four different power levels. Philips Hearing Solutions will soon launch the next generation of Philips HearLinkTM hearing aids. Featuring AI sound technology, the new hearing aid family will bring a significant change in hearing aid technology. It is developed to enable hearing aid users to connect with friends, family and colleagues, which is essential in order to live a social and active life. Philips HearLink is rechargeable, is able to stream directly from iOS and compatible Android devices and it is prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Bernafon and Sonic will also launch new hearing aids in the coming months. Specifically, Bernafon will introduce Bernafon Alpha that features Hybrid TechnologyTM, including a revolutionary approach to signal processing that always chooses the most optimal performance based on a precise analysis of the listening situation. Sonic will introduce Sonic Radiant, which comes with technology that actively finds, filters and fine-tunes sound so that the user can make the most of every moment. Both products feature direct streaming from iOS and compatible Android devices and are prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Over the coming weeks and months, the new flagship hearing aid families of our four hearing aid brands will be launched in all major markets. The products will be available in a range of price points and power levels - all based on the powerful miniRITE rechargeable style, which is built on state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. Starting today, our sales organisations will host a series of local launch events, conduct training sessions and launch marketing campaigns. Demant will host a virtual, live-streamed webcast today at 11:30am CET where key employees will present the new products in greater detail.

        <h4>Florida Posts Record Deaths GOP Convention Curbed Virus Update</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Florida posted a record number of 156 virus deaths. The Republican presidential convention in Florida will be scaled back as cases in the state continue to spike.Maryland's Republican governor criticized the Trump administration's handling of the virus, saying it &quot;bungled&quot; testing. The U.K. accused Russian state intelligence of trying to steal vaccine research. Hong Kong reported a record number of cases, the third time in about a week that its new outbreak breached previous high-water marks. The number of Americans filing for unemployment barely declined last week, signaling a slowing rebound in the labor market. The European Central Bank kept its pandemic bond-buying program at $1.5 trillion, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has so far calmed markets. Key Developments: Global Tracker: Cases top 13.5 million, deaths surpass 584,900 The number of cases of unknown origin will determine lockdown responses Greenwich mansions are all the rage in the pandemic era Fewer Covid ICU deaths suggest care is improving This big law firm has permanent plans for remote working Virus fumble exposes Netanyahu when he needs to look strong Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg's Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus. Maryland Governor Criticizes Trump on Testing (10:20 a.m. NY) Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, criticized the Trump administration's coronavirus response, saying it &quot;bungled&quot; coordinated nationwide testing by leaving it to unprepared states. &quot;The president was all over the place,&quot; Hogan wrote in the Washington Post. &quot;He avowed, falsely, that 'anybody' could get a test, even as my fellow governors were desperately pleading for help on testing. Then he shifted from boasting to blame.&quot; Florida Outbreak Forces Smaller Republican Convention (10:13 a.m. NY) The Republican National Committee is scaling back its convention next month in Jacksonville, Florida, as cases of the coronavirus spike in the state and some officials said they would not be going out of concern for their safety. For the first three days of the event, only party delegates will be allowed to attend. On the final day of the four-day event, when Donald Trump accepts the party's nomination for president, the RNC will allow delegates, their guests and alternate delegates to attend, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote in a letter Thursday to members. Germany Moves to Thwart Outbreaks From Travelers (9:22 a.m. NY) Germany tightened travel rules to prevent outbreaks of the coronavirus as the summer vacation season gets under way. Federal and state officials agreed to more stringent restrictions, but stopped short of a complete ban on travel to and from domestic hot spots. U.K. Says Russians Are Trying to Steal Vaccine Research (9 a.m. NY) The U.K. accused Russian state intelligence of hacking international pharmaceutical and academic research in a bid to win the race to secure a vaccine against Covid-19. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said vaccine and therapeutic sectors in multiple countries have been targeted, declining to list the names and number of institutions affected on security grounds. Britain named the group responsible for the hacking as APT29, saying it is &quot;almost certainly&quot; part of Russian state intelligence. The group also goes by the name of Cozy Bear or The Dukes and has targeted U.K., U.S. and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations. China's Sinopharm Begins Mass Testing of Vaccine in UAE (9 a.m. NY) Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm Group began the first mass trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm G42 will carry out the trial. The company will test 15,000 people as part of the Phase 3 trial, a milestone in the vaccine testing process that is normally followed by mass production, officials said. Chinese companies have had to look for places with active virus outbreaks to complete the final stage of human testing. U.S. Jobless Claims Post Smallest Decline Since March (8:33 a.m. NY) Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits posted the smallest weekly decline since March after coronavirus cases surged and reopenings paused or reversed across the South and West. Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 1.3 million in the week ended July 11, down 10,000 from the prior period, Labor Department figures showed Thursday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast a larger drop, to 1.25 million initial claims. Separately, U.S. retail sales exceeded forecasts in June for a second straight month as more businesses reopened and expanded jobless benefits padded the wallets of the unemployed, according to Commerce Department data. Israel Headed Toward Weekend Lockdown (8:13 a.m NY) Top Israeli ministers decided to impose a full lockdown for weekends in order to stem a rise in Covid-19 cases, according to a Channel 12 report. The plan is to shut malls and beaches, and restaurants will only be allowed to serve takeout food, the report said, adding the restrictions would be in place from Friday to Sunday mornings. Some schools would also be closed should the government pass these measures, according to the report. ECB Keeps Pandemic Stimulus Steady (7:47 a.m. NY) The European Central Bank kept its emergency monetary stimulus unchanged as the region's political leaders prepared to haggle over a plan to drag the economy out of the worst slump in living memory. ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues held their pandemic bond-buying program at 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) and interest rates at -0.5% on Thursday, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has so far calmed markets and kept borrowing costs low. Morgan Stanley Joins Gold Rush With Record Profit (7:35 a.m. NY) Morgan Stanley wrapped up a week of wins for Wall Street trading desks, capitalizing on the Federal Reserve's extraordinary rescue measures with record profit. Fixed-income trading revenue almost tripled, driving a 73% jump in total trading that surged past expectations. That spurred firmwide revenue and earnings to an all-time high amid wild market swings caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Almost Nine of Every 10 Wuhan Cases Undetected (7:30 a.m. NY) As many as 87% of Covid-19 cases in Wuhan, China, went undetected between January and March, according to a modelling study published in the journal Nature. People with no or mild symptoms probably played a major role in the coronavirus's rapid spread because they are difficult to detect and isolate, the scientists said. BofA Sets Aside Billions for Soured Loans (7:09 a.m. NY) Bank of America Corp.'s profit slid 52% as it joined rivals in preparing for an onslaught of consumer defaults spurred by the pandemic's economic fallout. Profit at the consumer-banking unit plunged 98% as the coronavirus shuttered much of the U.S. economy and caused tens of millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Nissan Plans 30% Global Production Cut (6:44 a.m. NY) Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. is planning a 30% year-on-year cut in global vehicle production through December, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. The automaker targets to produce around 2.6 million vehicles between April and December, down from 3.7 million during the same period in 2019. AstraZeneca Pressure Mounts Over Vaccine (6:10 a.m. NY) Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca Plc to deliver positive results from early tests evaluating the coronavirus vaccine it's developing with University of Oxford researchers as investors await data expected on Monday. The U.K. pharma company is staying quiet after British said results of phase 1 tests to be published in The Lancet medical journal were promising, driving the shares up late Wednesday. A paper is undergoing final editing and preparation and is due to be published on July 20. South Africa's Downward Cycle to Weigh on Households (5:27 p.m. HK) The South African economy extended its longest downward cycle since 1945 as restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus weighed on output and are set to hurt household finances even more. The economy entered the 80th month of a weakening cycle in July, according to data in the Reserve Bank's Quarterly Bulletin. That's after a nationwide lockdown that started on March 27 shuttered most activity and weighed on output. Hong Kong Sees Record Local Cases (4:55 p.m. HK) Hong Kong reported a record 63 local cases on Thursday, the third time in about a week that the city's new outbreak has breached previous high-water marks. Of the total confirmed cases, 35 were of unknown origins, the city's health department said. The new outbreak has now infected over 300 people in less than two weeks, with more than a third of infections unlinked to confirmed cases or existing outbreaks. Turkey's Budget Gap (4:34 p.m. HK) Turkey posted a budget deficit for a seventh month in June, as measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak paralyzed economic activity while spending jumped and tax deferrals chipped away at government revenue. The central government ran a monthly fiscal gap of 19.4 billion liras (about $2.8 billion) last month, bringing the deficit in the first half to 109.5 billion liras. That compares with a gap of 12.1 billion liras in June 2019 and an annual deficit of 123.7 billion liras last year. Pressure on AstraZeneca (3:59 p.m. HK) Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca Plc to deliver positive results from early tests evaluating the coronavirus vaccine it's developing with University of Oxford researchers as investors await data expected on Monday. The U.K. pharma company is staying quiet after British said results of phase 1 tests to be published in The Lancet medical journal were promising, driving the shares up on Wednesday. Signs of Trouble for U.K. Labor (3:51 p.m. HK) The number of hours worked in the U.K. economy fell the most on the record in the three months through May, underlining the risk facing the labor market as government income support is phased out. Hours plunged by 175 million, or almost 17%, to their lowest level since 1997, the Office for National Statistics said. Employment fell, vacancies dropped sharply and wage growth slowed to a virtual standstill. Bank Indonesia Cuts Rates for Second Month (3:28 p.m. HK) Bank Indonesia lowered its key interest rate for a second straight month, seeking to help the economy recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank cut its seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 4%, the lowest since the current rate system was adopted in 2016, as predicted by 18 of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. De Beers Sold Almost No Diamonds (2:41 p.m. HK) Anglo American Plc's De Beers sold sold $56 million of rough diamonds in the second quarter, down about 96% from a year earlier when sales totaled $1.3 billion. With jewelry stores closed, cutters and polishers stuck at home and global travel at a standstill, the entire diamond industry essentially came to a halt in the period. Beer, Watches Feel the Pain of Lockdowns (2:51 p.m. HK) The change in how people and companies spend their money through the pandemic reads like a tale of two economies. Quarterly earnings out Thursday are showing the hit to those on the wrong side of these structural shifts. Richemont -- heavily reliant on a decimated tourism industry -- saw almost half of its sales evaporate in the three months through June. Heineken NV reported a plunge in profit as lockdowns wiped out sales to bars and restaurants and led to a big impairment charge. Companies lucky enough to be in the winning segments of the economy, such as online fashion retailer Zalando SE and laboratory-equipment maker Sartorius AG, are riding high. Those reliant on broader economic confidence are struggling to see through the gloom, with recruitment firm Hays Plc saying the outlook is &quot;highly uncertain.&quot; Sweden Defends Controversial Virus Strategy (2:40 p.m. HK) Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he has no doubt Sweden's highly controversial strategy for fighting Covid-19 remains appropriate, even as the country's mortality rate tops the U.S. Lofven, who has seen his popularity flag as Sweden's decision not to impose a proper lockdown was followed by a spike in deaths, said he still thinks &quot;the strategy is right, I'm completely convinced of that,&quot; according to an interview with Aftonbladet. U.K. Labor Market Holds Up (2:17 p.m. HK) U.K. jobless claims fell in June and the economy lost fewer jobs than expected in the three months through May as government income support kept millions of people in work. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 28,100 to 2.63 million, and employment fell by less than half the expected drop, the Office for National Statistics said. The headline jobless rate stayed at 3.9%. Indonesia Plans to Punish Virus Rule Breakers (1:40 p.m. HK) Indonesia plans to fine violators of social distancing rules under a new law as President Joko Widodo steps up efforts to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Southeast Asia. Provincial chiefs will determine the types of punishment for offenders, Widodo told a meeting of governors in Jakarta. Earlier this week, the president told a cabinet meeting that people not wearing masks in public and those failing to maintain physical distance may be ordered to pay a fine or do social service. Tokyo, Victoria Report Daily Records (12:25 p.m. HK) Tokyo reported a daily record of 286 coronavirus cases, heightening concerns that the latest infection is spreading in the broader community and set to spill beyond the capital. The number comes after the city conducted more than 4,000 tests, also a record. While the initial flare-up in Tokyo came from nightclubs, authorities have expressed concern that more cases are now coming from more everyday locales such as restaurants, bars and workplaces. Meanwhile Victoria, Australia's second most populous state, recorded 317 new cases, its biggest spike. The increase comes a week after it was placed into partial lockdown and it's the largest single-day rise for any of Australia's states and territories, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ICU Death Rate Is Declining (8:45 a.m. HK) Overall mortality of Covid-19 patients treated in intensive-care units fell to just under 42% at the end of May from almost 60% in March, according to the first systematic analysis of two dozen studies involving more than 10,000 patients in Asia, Europe and North America. The fast spread of SARS-CoV-2, high caseload and proportion of patients requiring breathing support placed &quot;unprecedented demand&quot; on ICU services, researchers wrote in a study published Wednesday in the journal Anaesthesia. Countries in the later phases of the pandemic may now be coping better, they said. Air Canada Urges Trudeau to Relax Travel Rules (7:25 a.m. HK) Air Canada tried to persuade the government of Justin Trudeau to ease restrictions on travel, pointing to policy shifts in other nations where the pandemic has shown signs of improvement. In a letter to Transport Minister Marc Garneau and other cabinet members, the airline's chief medical officer suggested loosening quarantine requirements through &quot;a science-based approach&quot; to strike a balance between economic and public health concerns. In following some countries in Europe and Asia, Canada would enable a &quot;measured restart of aviation,&quot; he said. Record Day of Deaths in Texas (6:47 a.m. HK) Texas recorded its grimmest day yet with a record 110 Covid-19 deaths and almost 11,000 new cases, according to state health department data. The increase brought the Lone Star state's death toll since the start of the pandemic to 3,432. Hospitalizations ticked down by less than 1% statewide for just the second daily decline since late June, state figures showed. Reporting lags continued to bedevil efforts to assess the outbreak's trajectory. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in tweets that some fatalities reported on Wednesday occurred as long ago as early May. World Leaders Want Vaccine Fairness (6:10 a.m. HK) Eight world leaders including President Sahle-Work Zewde of Ethiopia and Sweden's Lofven issued a call for &quot;global solidarity&quot; for fairness in distributing any Covid-19 vaccine that may be developed. Supplies of a vaccine should be shared fairly among all nations and people of all income levels, the leaders said in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post. An organized global flow of vaccines will require &quot;mutual trust, transparency and accountability&quot; among nations, they said. Also signing the statement were prime ministers Justin Trudeau of Canada, New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Tunisia's Elyes Fakhfakh, who later resigned, as well as presidents Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. U.S. Cases Rise 2%, Matching 7-Day Average (4 p.m. NY) Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 2% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 3.47 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average gain over the past week. Deaths rose 0.6% to 136,940. Florida reported 301,810 cases, up 3.5% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 4.5% in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 4,521, an increase of 112, or 2.5%, Arizona reported 3,257 new cases, a 2.5% increase that was below the prior seven-day average gain of 2.9%. The state also reported 97 new deaths, the fifth increase in six days, bringing the toll to 2,434. Montana cases rose 7.4% to 2,096 according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

          (Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG is considering a separate listing of its Porsche sports-car unit in a deal that could boost its valuation and bring in a significant amount of cash, according to people familiar with the matter.The world's second-largest carmaker is speaking with advisers to study the merits of a potential initial public offering or spinoff of Porsche, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. VW could use any proceeds from a listing for acquisitions or technology investments, according to the people.Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess sounded the alarm in an interview with Bloomberg News last month about how Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle companies are cashing in on market optimism about their growth prospects. Investors have taken a dimmer view of VW and other incumbents, who will need to spend tens of billions to develop EVs while restructuring operations that revolve around combustion engines.VW's preferred shares rose as much as 6% in Frankfurt trading. At about $757 billion, Tesla's market value is roughly seven times higher than VW's 90 billion euros ($109 billion).''A Volkswagen IPO of its Porsche brand would be a bold solution to generating much-needed shareholder value,'' Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. Porsche's plan to be almost all-electric by 2030, with the exception of the 911 model, could ''attract Tesla-like multiples while generating a Ferrari-like Ebitda margin.''Dean said his analysis indicates that Porsche has a value of 110 billion euros, more than its parent.Listing TimetableA Porsche listing could take place next year, though no firm timetable has been decided, the people said. VW plans to keep a majority stake if it pursues an IPO of the business, according to the people.Deliberations are ongoing, and there's no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for VW declined to comment. Manager Magazin reported earlier Thursday that VW is weighing a listing of Porsche, citing unidentified people.VW so far has little to show for the asset review it started in 2016, in the wake of its diesel-emissions scandal, to explore options for niche brands and non-core operations. The company pushed through a downsized IPO of its trucks unit Traton SE in 2019 after internal wrangling almost derailed the project.Labor leaders and the Porsche and Piech families who own VW resisted efforts in 2017 to sell Ducati in 2017, and similar opposition emerged late last year when reports speculated the company might offload the motorcycle unit. While VW folded Ducati, Lamborghini and Italdesign into a structure that made it somewhat easier to make ownership changes, the company announced a month later that it would keep them.Valuation FrustrationValuation has been a vexing issue for Diess, 62, who set a goal in 2019 to make VW worth 200 billion euros. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company has ample cash to afford a massive budget to develop EVs and invest in the software the CEO sees as critical to the industry's future.VW already has placed bets on promising startups including battery companies NorthVolt AB and QuantumScape Corp. It also invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, Ford Motor Co.'s autonomous-car development partner, in 2019.After Diess agitated late last year for a more comprehensive overhaul of VW and clashed with key stakeholders, the supervisory board defused the conflict by throwing its full support behind the CEO and naming several of his allies to key management posts. The company said it intended to hammer out a plan with unions by the end of this quarter to reduce fixed costs 5% by 2023 and lower material costs by 7% in the next two years.Dramatic HistoryA Porsche listing or IPO would partially reverse an acquisition concluded in 2012, when Volkswagen bought the remaining 50.1% stake in Porsche's automotive business for 4.46 billion euros. That step ended a seven-year takeover saga that divided two of the most powerful families in Germany.The two brands are historically linked through Ferdinand Porsche, the creator of the original VW Beetle. His descendants, who controlled the sports-, racked up more than 10 billion euros of debt in an unsuccessful attempt to take over Europe's largest carmaker.The two companies agreed to combine in 2009. The deal made the Porsche-Piech clan, which included the late former VW CEO Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's largest shareholders.The operating Porsche unit for which VW is considering a listing or IPO is separate from Porsche Automobile Holding SE, a holding company that has 53.3% of VW's ordinary shares.(Updates with analyst's comment in the fifth paragraph.)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- On a scorching hot day in late August, representatives of Taiwan's government and industry crowded into the clinical cool of a state-of-the-art semiconductor facility for a symbolic moment in the global tech conflict. They were attending the opening ceremony for a training center built by Dutch company ASML Holding at a cost of about $16 million, small change for an industry used to spending $10 billion or more on a single advanced manufacturing plant. The real value of the site in the southern city of Tainan is strategic: It's one of just two such facilities outside the Netherlands capable of training semiconductor engineers to fabricate cutting-edge chips on ASML machines. Fellow U.S. ally South Korea hosts the other - and Washington is working hard to ensure China never acquires the same technology. As the U.S.-China confrontation takes root, the ability to craft chips for everything from artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones has become an issue of national security, injecting government into business decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them. Those tensions could kick into overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China's domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities. Semiconductors made from silicon wafers mounted with billions of microscopic transistors are the basic component of modern digital life and the building blocks of innovation for the future. They are arguably one of the world's most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year, scale that up to the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it's worth some $5.2 trillion globally, according to German manufacturers. Politics is roiling that business model, sparking a drive for more autonomy from the U.S. to China, Europe and Japan. &quot;We're in a new world where governments are more concerned about the security of their digital infrastructure and the resiliency of their supply chains,&quot; said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy with the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association. &quot;The techno-nationalist trends gaining traction in multiple capitals around the world are a challenge to the semiconductor industry.&quot; At once highly globalized and yet concentrated in the hands of a few countries, the industry has choke points that the U.S. under the presidency of Donald Trump has sought to exploit in order to thwart China's plans to become a world leader in chip production. Washington says Beijing can only achieve that goal through state subvention at the expense of U.S. industry, while furthering Communist Party access to high-tech tools for surveillance and repression. China rejects the allegations, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and acting out of political motivation. For both sides, Taiwan, which is responsible for some 70% of chips manufactured to order, is the new front line. Beijing is increasingly hostile toward Taiwan, a democratically governed island it regards as its territory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s status as the world's largest contract chipmaker - a trend taking over the industry - the go-to supplier for Apple Inc. and the focus of next-generation chip-making, adds another dimension to China's enmity, and to its standoff with the U.S. TSMC has become &quot;turf that all geopolitical players want to secure,&quot; founder Morris Chang said in November.Just a couple of kilometers from the new training center, cranes dot a massive construction site where TSMC is building &quot;fabs&quot; in which it will manufacture the most advanced chips in the world - chips that are no longer available to China's Huawei Technologies due to U.S. export controls. Huawei used to be TSMC's second-largest customer, accounting for 14% of sales, those shipments stopped in September. The White House has also imposed export restrictions on China's largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., having already squashed Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., once among Beijing's biggest hopes to climb the chip ladder. The U.S. is also reaching out to key players at home and abroad to ask them to reconsider their relations with China. China's intentions are so alarming to America because chips can be dual-use items with military applications, according to a former official familiar with the U.S. administration's efforts. &quot;They are the fundamental basis of our qualitative military advantage, from missiles to radars to submarines,&quot; the official said. After decades when the industry was encouraged to go global, Trump is attempting to reel it back home. The CHIPS for America Act introduced to Congress in June aims to set up incentives to support semiconductor manufacturing and research in the U.S. One executive at a Chinese semiconductor company, asking not to be named due to commercial and political sensitivities, said three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews the national security implications of transactions. Germany has also been effectively cut off, making any deals very difficult, the person said. China &quot;firmly opposes the unjustified suppression&quot; of its companies by the U.S. &quot;under the weakest pretext of national security,&quot; and will continue to defend them, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in late September. China - the world's biggest semiconductor market, accounting for more than 50% of all chips sold - isn't standing by as its high-tech ambitions are kneecapped. That outsized demand means many major deals need Beijing's sign-off: Qualcomm gave up its pursuit of NXP Semiconductors in 2018 after failing to win approval from China.China's five-year plan for the chip industry will lend it the same strategic importance Beijing gave to its atomic bomb program. What's more, a law passed Oct. 17 may allow China to hit back at the U.S., with speculation that it could prompt export controls on rare earths used in chip production. Still, the rolling restrictions imposed by Trump haven't just hit China's chip capabilities but are upending the entire industry. And there's scant sign of a climbdown, whoever wins the U.S. election in November. Citing the need to promote &quot;digital sovereignty,&quot; the European Commission is exploring a 30 billion-euro ($35 billion) drive to raise Europe's share of the world chip market to 20%, from less than 10% now. Japan is also looking to bolster its domestic capacity. At least one Japanese delegation traveled to Taiwan in May and June this year in the hope of convincing TSMC to invest in Japan, a person with knowledge of the visit said. But TSMC announced in May that it was building a $12 billion facility in Arizona, and the company declined to receive any foreign visitors seeking to woo it, said another person familiar with the company's thinking. Both asked not to be named discussing corporate strategy. Meanwhile South Korea, home to Samsung, the No. 1 memory chipmaker, is striving for more self-reliance after Japan imposed export curbs last year on chemicals used in semiconductor manufacture during a flare-up in the countries' tensions over Japan's wartime past. While the U.S. remains dominant with giants like Intel Corp and Qualcomm and a virtual monopoly on the software essential to chip design, &quot;there's no region in the world that can proclaim strategic autonomy in semiconductors,&quot; said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the Technology and Geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. &quot;Take out any of these players and the value chain falls down.&quot; In January, days before Trump signed an initial trade deal with China, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sat down for dinner with around 30 CEOs in Silicon Valley. He was the guest of Keith Krach, a 30-year veteran of the tech scene who was appointed undersecretary for economic growth in June 2019. Pompeo had a message for them: China's Communist Party &quot;is a threat to your companies because they don't want to compete, they want to put you out of business,&quot; Krach recalled him saying, he told a virtual conference of the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Sept. 29. Trump may have weaponized the semiconductor value chain, but it was the Obama administration that first acted on the threat posed by China, unveiling a semiconductor strategy in January 2017 as one of its last acts. Trump picked up the baton, but the nature of the supply chain means that others are in the U.S. line of sight. Israel - a high-tech R&amp;D hub where Intel is the largest private employer - exported semiconductors worth about $2.1 billion last year, with about half going to China, data compiled by UN Comtrade shows. That closeness to China risks becoming a liability. Zvika Orron, a partner at Israel's Viola Ventures who leads semiconductor investing, said there's a hesitancy on the Israeli side to look to China because of worry that Chinese funding could imperil future U.S. deals. Carice Witte, founder of the SIGNAL nonprofit focused on Israel-China ties, said the U.S. is bound to &quot;start asking more questions.&quot; The U.K. is another pinch point thanks to Arm Ltd., whose instruction set - the basic code that allows chips to communicate with software - underlies everything from smartphones to the world's fastest supercomputer. Arm currently sells to China, but the company's takeover by Nvidia Corp puts that business in doubt. If the $40 billion deal wins regulatory approval, Arm would fall under American jurisdiction and become even more subject to U.S. export controls. While the U.K. government has yet to show its hand, it allowed the sale of Arm to Softbank of Japan in 2016, so wouldn't normally be expected to intervene now. But the newly strategic nature of the industry has prompted lawmakers to call for a review of the deal's implications. Here too there are concerns at being caught between the U.S. and China. Losing a world-class technology company to the U.S. for the Department of Justice to &quot;weaponize&quot; is not a good place to be, according to a person with knowledge of British national security considerations. The risk, they said, is a U.K. strategic asset becomes &quot;recognized as part of the U.S. arsenal&quot; in its campaign against China. Over the Taiwan Strait on mainland China, the mood at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in late August was gloomy. Chinese executives worried what the Trump administration might do next to hobble Beijing's progress. &quot;The conflict remains very fluid, which makes it impossible to predict what next moves both sides are going to take,&quot; said Huang Yan, application and sales director at Senodia Technology, a Shanghai-based chip design company that develops sensor chips for smartphones. China is on course to import $300 billion of semiconductors for the third straight year, underscoring its dependence on U.S. technology. That's something President Xi Jinping is determined to end. Xi has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies from artificial intelligence to wireless networks. A focus of Beijing is to accelerate research into so-called third-generation semiconductors - circuits made of materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, a fledgling technology where no country dominates. Yet without silicon capabilities it will be difficult for China to build a proper semiconductor industry, said a senior TSMC official. Another person from a company involved in third-generation chip production said designing them is an art, and even poaching a team of designers won't necessarily guarantee success. The consensus is it won't be easy for China to catch up, especially at the cutting-edge where TSMC and Samsung are producing chips whose circuits are measured in single-digit nanometers, or billionths of a meter. SMIC would have to double annual research spending in the next two-to-three years just to prevent its technology gap with those companies widening, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. The tussle raises the prospect of a broader decoupling of the global industry with two distinct supply chains. As with 5G, the question then becomes one of the extent of each system: Does China's high-tech gravity pull in Southeast Asia and parts of Europe, or is it confined to its immediate neighborhood? How many allies will side with the U.S.? To be sure, the chip industry is still thriving, with the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up about 30% this year. Geopolitics is now a feature of boardrooms, said the SIA's Goodrich, but 5G and AI are likely to cause more market upheaval. The direction of travel still worries key players. Shares of Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. chipmaker, fell in September after it was forced to halt shipments to Huawei, its biggest customer. Complete decoupling would harm U.S. competitiveness and hurt China, raising the prospect of less money for R&amp;D, slowing innovation, said Goodrich. &quot;A world in which the U.S. and China are independent from one another is a negative outcome for everyone.&quot; ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Six Questions U.S. Investors Should Ask SoftBank's CEO Son</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son will be in New York on Monday to pitch hedge funds and financial institutions on the merits of SoftBank Group Corp., in the first such meeting since the implosion of WeWork. Convincing investors the tide has turned will hinge on a handful of key questions. Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp. last month said it had taken a stake in SoftBank because the Japanese company's shares are woefully undervalued compared with its assets. At Monday's event, organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the billionaire is likely to point to the approved sale of Sprint Corp., a rally in Uber Technologies Inc. shares and Elliott's purchase of SoftBank stock as signs of changing fortunes. Son, 62, can speak for hours about artificial intelligence and SoftBank's role in the &quot;information revolution,&quot; but investors are likely to focus on more mundane topics. How Will He Respond to Elliott? Speaking at an earnings briefing on Feb. 13, Son called the New York-based activist investor an &quot;important partner&quot; and said he's in broad agreement with Elliott's arguments for buybacks and increasing the stock price. Son has signaled less receptiveness to Elliott's other suggestions: selling more of the stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and reining in the Vision Fund, a $100 billion investment vehicle that accounted for more than $10 billion of losses in the past two quarters. Son is personally handling interactions with Elliott, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, head of the Vision Fund Rajeev Misra, and SoftBank Group's Robert Townsend are also closely involved, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. The news of Elliott's stake, which people familiar with the matter have said is a nearly $3 billion, sent SoftBank's shares to the highest in a year, but have since retreated over 10%. It's not clear whether representatives from Elliott will be at the Monday event, which was scheduled before the activist investor disclosed its stake and is not designed to specifically address its involvement. Will He Fund a Big Buyback? Elliott has called for a buyback of as much as $20 billion, which would be several times SoftBank's biggest repurchase to date. The company's last buyback was its biggest at 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion). Announced in February 2019, it sparked a rally that pushed the stock to its highest price in about two decades. Selling Alibaba shares to pay for a buyback, as Elliott has proposed, could be a point of contention with Son. In the past, Son has used its stake as collateral to borrow money for big acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of chip designer ARM Holdings. Son said during SoftBank's latest quarterly financial briefing that he'd prefer to sell as little as possible and that there's &quot;no rush&quot; to do so. While Elliott and SoftBank have yet to discuss specific amounts, a buyback is an easy sell for Son, since one was already in the works before the activist's involvement, the person familiar said. SoftBank has also stoked expectations when it announced on Feb. 19 plans to borrow as much as 500 billion yen by putting up shares of its Japanese telecom unit as collateral. How Risky is SoftBank's Debt Load? The loan has raised questions about SoftBank's massive debt pile. SoftBank said the money will come from 16 financial institutions and pledged as much as 953 million shares of SoftBank Corp. as collateral. Overseas banks will provide the bulk of the margin loan, with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG contributing 68 billion yen each, the Nikkei reported. &quot;It's very worrisome that to raise just a few billion dollars of debt, Son had to go to a dozen banks. On top of that they had to put up collateral worth $15 billion,&quot; said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. &quot;It looks like Japanese banks are worried about concentration risks.&quot; SoftBank had 19.25 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of Dec. 31, a 23% increase since the start of the fiscal year in April. Sprint's imminent merger with T-Mobile will lighten the load by about 4.9 trillion yen. Still, SoftBank may find it a challenge to balance shareholder returns with big-ticket investments in technology companies. The company had 3.8 trillion yen of cash and equivalents, while more than 2.6 trillion yen of bonds are coming due in the next three years. What is the Vision Fund's Future? The Vision Fund is recovering from a series of stumbles. WeWork's plan to go public last year imploded, forcing SoftBank to arrange a rescue financing of $9.5 billion in October. Uber, despite a recent surge, is trading about 24% below last year's offering price. The fund has suffered other high-profile setbacks, including investments in failed online retailer Brandless Inc., dog-walking app Wag Labs Inc. and pizza robot company Zume Pizza Inc. Elliott wants SoftBank to set up a special committee to review investment processes at the Vision Fund. It also argues the fund has dragged down the share price despite making up a small portion of assets under management, said people familiar with the discussions. Son himself has conceded that missteps with the original fund are making it difficult to raise money for a successor. He said in February that SoftBank may need to invest in startups using solely its own capital for a year or two. &quot;Vision Fund 1 companies will need more cash and many of them will not be able to get it at the same valuation, which means more losses for SoftBank,&quot; Jefferies' Goyal said. &quot;Without a second Vision Fund, how will these companies get funding?&quot; Will He Improve Governance? Some at SoftBank are resistant to the idea of an oversight committee. Instead, SoftBank is seeking to resolve issues at the Vision Fund with new governance standards for the companies it invests in. The new rules will encompass how the fund approaches the composition of the board of directors, founder and management rights, rights of shareholders, and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest. SoftBank recognized the need for more oversight as early as 2018, when it charged Claure with a broad review of operations across SoftBank companies. The COO, formerly the head of Sprint, spent months assembling a team of about 40 executives. In the end, he was forced to cede control of the so-called SoftBank Operating Group to Misra, the head of the fund it was supposed to be overseeing. Will He Support Rajeev Misra? The spat was only the latest in a string of internal conflicts centered on Misra, the veteran Wall Street trader who once ran the Deutsche Bank subprime team immortalized in &quot;The Big Short.&quot; News reports alleged that Misra masterminded attacks that led to the departures of SoftBank President Nikesh Arora and Alok Sama, a contender for Misra's position at the Vision Fund. The latest revelations in a Wall Street Journal story last week detailed an alleged smear campaign that included a $500,000 payment to a shadowy Italian businessman who had worked with private intelligence operatives and computer hackers, and attempts at sexual blackmail. &quot;If these allegations are true, Misra has damaged not only his own reputation, but that of SoftBank as a whole,&quot; Goyal said. &quot;Mr. Son will do well to address this ASAP.&quot; SoftBank's board of directors had previously completed a review of allegations about Arora and concluded the claims are without merit. The company also said that it is looking into latest details. &quot;Misra could be the sacrificial lamb,&quot; said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. &quot;Throwing him under the bus would certainly send a signal that things are changing.&quot; To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net,Takahiko Hyuga in Tokyo at thyuga@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Giles Turner, Nate Lanxon ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Asia Electronics Sector Booms, Bucking Global Economic Slump</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Global trade data in the Covid-19 era has been generally abysmal, but look a little closer and the electronics sector that fires Asia's trade engines could be headed for a pretty good year. In South Korea, semiconductor exports rose in May and imports of equipment used in producing semiconductors surged 168%, trade ministry data show. Taiwan's electronic-component exports, which include chips, grew 13.2% in May to $10.2 billion, even as total exports fell 2% from a year earlier. The electronics industry is holding up relatively well amid the pandemic as companies adopt new technologies -- including 5G equipment and automation tools -- that make it easier for employees to work remotely. A sustainable boost will depend on whether consumers return with similar vigor, and whether other factors such as U.S.-China tensions don't interfere with digital demand and supply. &quot;The tech industry seems to have decoupled from the overall economy somewhat, as the tech industry is still growing well&quot; and has been &quot;relatively immune to Covid-19,&quot; Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said at a shareholder meeting June 9. Read More: Little-Known Data Show Signs of a Tech Bounce: Tim Culpan TSMC, the main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., still plans to spend as much as $16 billion on capacity upgrades and technology this year, and expects revenue gains in the mid- to high-teens, Liu said. Covid-19 has helped drive some budding technologies related to remote work and education and social distancing, he added. TSMC shares have risen 25% since their lowest close for the year on March 19, less than the 30% gain in Taiwan's benchmark Taiex stock index in that time. TSMC shares were down 2.2% as of 1:32 p.m. Monday, compared to a 0.98% drop in the Taiex. Amid generally awful export figures from the region, &quot;the one bright spot is semiconductors,&quot; said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. &quot;A lot of this reflects the product cycle and also the global lockdown and suppression that favor the 'digitalization' of economic activities, driving demand for electronic goods like chips.&quot; Budding Technologies For economies like South Korea and Taiwan that rely on tech exports, &quot;the upturn in demand for electronics has been a pillar of support amid the coronavirus pandemic,&quot; said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics Ltd. &quot;However, the improvement in the tech sector won't be able to offset significant demand weakness in non-electronic exports,&quot; he said, adding that even the surge in PC demand &quot;could be a one-off,&quot; attributable to the sudden shift to telecommuting during the pandemic. Still, it helps that some of Asia's most tech-focused economies have had relative success in containing the virus: Taiwan has reported just seven virus deaths, South Korea flattened its curve fairly early and Singapore's fatality rate is among the world's lowest. That gives momentum to efforts to restart tech engines and get consumers used to new ways of doing business. &quot;We're seeing more countries pledging economic reforms, and there's increased urgency for a stronger technology push to lead the economic recovery,&quot; said Zhao Defa, an economist at Continuum Economics in Singapore. &quot;Given that South Korea and Taiwan are the world's main semiconductor producers, they will be beneficiaries.&quot; Some of the boom is specific to the health crisis, amid a global scramble for medical equipment and demand for video-conferencing and other technologies as work and school shift more to people's homes. China's medical exports and shipments of high-tech electronics jumped in both April and May, for example, while Singapore's pharmaceutical shipments surged 174% in April from a year earlier. Further gains may not be as pronounced. Consumer demand is still lagging, though. South Korean shipments of computer products jumped 83% in May, their eighth straight monthly gain, but sales of smartphones dropped 22% and consumer appliances fell 37%. Globally, smartphone shipments are expected to fall 11.9% this year -- their biggest annual drop ever, according to data from research firm IDC. While 5G, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence will all create demand for Taiwan's exports, setbacks from Covid-19 and U.S.-China tech tensions could constrain that progress, Beatrice Tsai, director-general of the statistics department at Taiwan's Ministry of Finance, said June 8. Still, analysts at Citigroup Inc. see a risk that U.S.-China tensions will weigh on chip demand. China's buildup of chip inventories was intended partly to get ahead of a U.S. ban on Huawei set to take effect later this year. China's export orders have taken a hit from lockdowns in the U.S. and key European markets, said Rajiv Biswas, APAC chief economist at IHS Markit. A second-half recovery in those economies, as well as Christmas orders, could drive a rebound in tech exports, he said. Governments have tried to stay focused on the long view, aiming to take advantage of the tech sector's relative advantage in the pandemic by providing special support for electronics firms and new technologies. Singapore pledged S$500 million ($360 million) last month to help businesses in their digital transformations, including moving hawker center stalls to e-payments, and is spending another S$3.5 billion on information and communications technology to mitigate the virus outbreak. When the virus's spread threatened Vietnam's burgeoning tech industry, the government granted an exception to its otherwise strict lockdown measures: Samsung Electronics Co., which makes about half of its smartphones in factories near Hanoi and is one of Vietnam's largest investors, was allowed to shuttle in more than 1,000 engineers from South Korea. &quot;The recovery will be digital,&quot; Anand Swaminathan, senior partner and head of McKinsey Digital in Asia, said in a June 9 interview. Asian governments are &quot;all starting to figure out what their investment strategy is on digital.&quot; (Updates market levels in sixth paragraph, adds analyst quote in eighth and ninth paragraphs.) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Tokyo New Cases Rise Iran, Russia Infections Slow: Virus Update</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Tokyo discovered another 290 new cases while Australia canceled its next planned sitting of parliament because of risks posed by the nation's coronavirus outbreak. Russia reported its smallest daily increase since March. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden slammed the Trump administration's handling of the virus, saying it's trying to hide the skyrocketing number of cases from public view. Texas reported record deaths for a third straight day. The Texas Republican Party won a last-minute ruling allowing it to move thousands of delegates into Houston's convention center this weekend amid a coronavirus surge. More U.S. national retailers imposed in-store mask requirements. President Donald Trump told Fox News he supports mask wearing, but would not impose a national mandate. Key Developments: Global Tracker: Cases pass 14.1 million, deaths top 603,000 World must face Covid without vaccine, virus hunter says Russia is trying to beat the West to a Covid-19 vaccine South Africa data may underreport virus deaths, experts say How blind spots in Melbourne sparked virus crisis Mask or no mask? And which kind? What the experts say: QuickTake Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg's Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus. Iran Adds Fewer Infections (6 a.m. NY) Iran recorded 188 fatalities from the virus overnight, up from 183 the day before, bringing the death toll to 13,979. The number of known infections reached 271,606 with 2,166 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from 2,379 on Friday. Some 235,000 people have recovered and 3,529 patients are in intensive care units. Indonesia Cases Climb 2.1% (4:51 p.m. HK) Indonesia reported 1,752 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, bringing the total figure to 84,882 since the first cases were reported in early March. The number of fatalities remains the highest in Southeast Asia at 4,016. The increase of 2.1% compares with the 2% average for the previous seven days. Russian Cases Rise Least Since March (3:40 p.m. HK) Russia said cases rose 0.8%, the lowest daily increase since the government began publishing data in March. The 6,234 new confirmed infections in the past day bring the total to 765,437, according to data from the Russian government's virus response center. Another 124 people died, bringing Russia's total death toll from the disease to 12,247. U.K. Home Antibody Test Passes Trials: Telegraph (3 p.m. HK) A home antibody test developed by Oxford University with backing from the U.K. government passed its first major trial, the Telegraph reported, citing the head of the government's testing body. Ministers are drawing up plans to distribute millions of the tests for free after they were shown to be 98.6% accurate in secret human trials held last month, the newspaper said. The fingerprick test can tell within 20 minutes whether a person has ever been exposed to coronavirus. Scientists Find Six Types of Covid: Telegraph (2:55 p.m. HK) Six distinct types of coronavirus have been identified by scientists, the Telegraph said. Scientists used artificial intelligence software to identify &quot;clusters&quot; of symptoms and ranked them in order of severity. Headache and loss of smell are common to all six groupings. Scientists at King's College London found that patients with the sixth type of Covid-19 are nearly 10 times more likely to end up needing breathing support than patients in the first group. They used data from 1,600 users of its symptom tracker app in the U.K. and U.S. who had confirmed cases. The resulting algorithm was then tested on a further 1,000 users in those countries as well as Sweden. Almost One-Third of Iranians May Have Had Virus (2:50 p.m. HK) Some 25 million Iranians are estimated to have contracted the coronavirus so far and 35 million more are at the risk of getting the infection, President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech on Saturday, citing a Health Ministry report. Iran has recorded nearly 13,800 deaths and 270,000 confirmed cases since it detected its first case five months ago. German Infection Rate Edges Higher (2:46 p.m. HK) Germany's infection rate rose slightly, while the number of new cases stayed significantly below the level at the height of the outbreak. There were 595 new cases in the 24 hours through Saturday morning, bringing the total to 202,045. There was one additional fatality, increasing the total to 9,088. Tokyo Finds 290 New Cases (2:24 p.m. HK) Tokyo saw a third straight day of more than 200 new cases. Infections totaled 290 on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK said, citing sources at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. That's close to the record 293 cases reported a day earlier. Officials in Japan have so far resisted reimposing additional restrictions. There's no need to declare a state of emergency right now and the Tokyo medical system isn't under pressure, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Friday. Australia Cancels Next Parliament Sitting (11:46 a.m. HK) Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Saturday he had made a request to the speaker that the session due to start Aug. 4 not be held following public health advice, citing threats including increased community transmission in the southern state of Victoria. Victoria's capital, Melbourne, was placed into lockdown last week after breaches of hotel quarantine procedures. Iran Cases Touch 269,440 (11:08 a.m. HK) The number of confirmed cases in Iran stands at 269,440, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The number of fatalities is 13,791. Hong Kong May Extend Measures (10:36 a.m. HK) David Hui, a Chinese University infectious disease expert, told RTHK that the Hong Kong government's social distancing rules -- set to expire on Tuesday -- will probably be extended. The city's economy is mired in its deepest recession on record after a disastrous year of social unrest and then the virus outbreak. Texas GOP In-Person Convention Back On (9:45 a.m.HK) U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes granted an emergency request by party officials to reinstate the in-person meeting for the selection of the Texas GOP's presidential electors. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, canceled the gathering last week after the city's top medical officer testified that such a large indoor gathering could become a &quot;super-spreader&quot; event. South Korea Confirms 39 More Cases (9:24 a.m. HK) South Korea reported 39 more Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, raising the total tally to 13,711, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention. One additional death was reported. China Adds 22 New Cases (9:00 a.m. HK) China added 22 new coronavirus cases on July 17, the National Health Commission said Saturday. Xinjiang had 16 local cases. There were three imported cases in Guangdong, two in Shandong and one in Fujian. Beijing had no new cases. Biden Criticizes Administration's Response (8:40 a.m. HK) Biden said the official count of the toll remains hidden from view in a non-public database at a separate government agency overseen by the President's political appointees. &quot;What he is doing is keeping detailed data from the group of scientists who could make best use of it: the men and women at the Centers for Disease Control,&quot; the former vice president said in an emailed statement. &quot;Donald Trump has waved the white flag and retreated in the face of the challenge of Covid-19. Now he is literally trying to hide.&quot; Trump Rules Out Mask Mandate (6:40 a.m. HK) President Trump said that while he supports the use of masks as protection against the coronavirus he does not believe that wearing a face covering should be mandatory for the nation. &quot;I want people to have a certain freedom,&quot; Trump said in an interview with Fox News, an excerpt of which was broadcast by the network ahead of its full airing on Sunday. Moderna Shorts Cost Almost $1.5 Billion (6:35 a.m. HK) Those betting against high-flying vaccine developer Moderna Inc. have taken their lumps this year with the biotech's 370% rally costing short sellers almost $1.5 billion, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm has boomed into a $36 billion behemoth amid excitement for its vaccine to treat the coronavirus. Court Rules in Favor of Texas Convention (5:45 p.m. NY) The Texas Republican Party got the green light to move thousands of delegates into the Houston convention center this weekend after the party's attempt at a virtual convention proved a bust, a lawyer for the party said. U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes granted an emergency request by Texas GOP officials Friday to reinstate the in-person political gathering, which was canceled last week by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. Turner, a Democrat, cited health risks at a time when the city's coronavirus infections and hospitalizations are skyrocketing. Brazil Adds More Than 34,000 Cases (5:35 p.m. NY) Brazil reported 34,177 new virus cases, a day after the nation passed the milestone of 2 million infections. It has the second highest number after the U.S. Another 1,163 deaths were reported, for a total of 77,851. The World Health Organization said the outbreak has reached a plateau. &quot;The rise in Brazil is no longer exponential,&quot; WHO Executive Director Michael Ryan said. &quot;There is a plateau, there is an opportunity here now for Brazil to push the disease down, to suppress the transmission of the virus, to take control.&quot; Texas Deaths Break Record for Third Day (5:20 p.m. NY) Texas virus deaths broke records for a third consecutive day, with 174 fatalities that pushed the tally-to-date to 3,735, according to state health department figures. The clash between local control and state rules setting limits on virus safety mandates in Texas deepened Friday. State Attorney General Ken Paxton issued guidance that private religious schools don't have to abide by restrictions being issued by cities or counties, such as a Dallas County edict this week barring in-person instruction until after Labor Day, Sept. 7. &quot;This guidance allows religious private schools to determine for themselves when to reopen free from any government mandate or interference,&quot; Paxton wrote. U.S. Cases Rise 2.1% (4 p.m. NY) Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 2.1% as compared with the same time Thursday to 3.61 million, as of 3:01 p.m. New York time, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. Deaths rose by 943 to 138,840. Florida reported 327,241 cases, up 3.6% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 4.5% in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 4,805, an increase of 128, or 2.7%, Arizona reported 3,910 new cases, a 2.9% rise to 138,523 that was above the prior seven-day average of 2.6%. The state reported 91 new virus deaths, bringing the total to 2,583. Montana cases rose 6.1% to 2,366 according to the data from Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Maskless Xi, China's Modest GDP Target, Hong Kong: NPC Update</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China's most senior officials gathered in Beijing to kick off the annual full-session of the country's parliament, the National People's Congress.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang unveiled a conservative target for economic growth this year of above 6% that signals more restrained monetary and fiscal policies this year, in contrast to other major nations still pumping in stimulus. But China's new five-year plan that runs through 2025 didn't give a numeric target for average growth.What to Know:Click here to read more on this year's NPCEverything you need to knowFull NPC reports.

Reaction to GDP goalHow China plans to be greener by 2025Clips of other reactions here and here. Key takeaways hereLatest developments: (Time-stamps are local time in Beijing)The opening session of the NPC at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesUpcoming Events: Foreign Minister, 5-Year Plan BriefingKey upcoming NPC events that have been announced so far include:March 7, afternoon - Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks to mediaMarch 8, 10 a.m. - NDRC Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe discusses 14th five-year plan at briefingMarch 8, 3 p.m. - NPC plenary session, with delegates listening to work reports delivered by NPC standing committee chairman, head of of the supreme court and the top procuratorMarch 11, 3 p.m. - NPC closing session. Delegates will vote on work reports, 14th Five-Year Plan, and other legislative revisions including decision on revising Hong Kong's electoral systemMaskless Xi (2:22 p.m.)Despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all - including President Xi Jinping - appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country's biggest political gathering of the year.While officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People's Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year's NPC, seen as a statement on China's virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.Delegates applaud as Xi Jinping arrives for the opening session of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesExport to Rise More Than 50% (2:20 p.m.)China's exports may have risen more than 50% in January to February, He Lifeng, head of the nation's economic planning agency, said in a group interview. Power consumption and generation increased by more than 20%, the economy kept improving in the first two months, though the external environment poses challenges to the Chinese economy, he said.Family Offices Overhaul (12:30 p.m.)Xiao Gang, former chairman of China's securities regulator, proposed revising the nation's family trust law, saying impediments such as high taxes have forced many family trusts to hoard cash rather than make investments, according to the China Securities Journal.Assets controlled by China's wealthiest people are expected to double from 2019 to 116 trillion yuan ($18 trillion) by 2025, according to UBS Global Research. But according to a Credit Suisse Group AG report in October, wealth inequality has also risen rapidly, estimating that the country had 5.8 million millionaires and 21,100 residents had wealth of above $50 million - more than any country except the U.S. - at the end of 2019.Steelmakers Optimistic (12:27 p.m.)Chinese steelmakers are optimistic for this year as the nation's efforts to decarbonize and consolidate the industry continue, the China Economic Times reported, citing steel mill executives at the National People's Congress. Demand will improve this year, benefiting from high growth targets set by local governments at the start of the 14th five-year plan, according to Xia Wenyong, chairman of Xinyu Iron &amp; Steel Group. Steel production may drop marginally after the country's pledge to cut output from a record high last year, said Li Lijian, chairman of Anyang Iron &amp; Steel Group.Feeding 1.4 Billion Mouths (12:25 p.m.)China rolled out a to boost crop production in the world's most populous nation, highlighting concerns over food security after the country imported record amounts of meat, corn and soybeans last year. Measures include creating agricultural belts devoted to large-scale farming and providing sufficient subsidies to motivate grain farmers, according to the latest five-year plan that sets out key economic and political goals through 2025.Food security is moving to the top of the government's agenda after the coronavirus pandemic and outbreaks of African swine fever raised concerns over whether China could guarantee food supplies for its 1.4 billion people. Imports of meat and grains surged last year, driving global prices higher and stoking worries over food inflation.Fresh Blow to Tech Giants (12:27 p.m.)China called on its technology giants to share key data, dealing a further blow to the companies already reeling from heightened antitrust scrutiny.Companies are encouraged to open up data related to areas from search to e-commerce and social media, in order to promote the healthy development of the sharing and online economies, according to a government report outlining the Communist Party's top priorities for the next five years. Beijing is also establishing a platform for sharing public and government data.China also pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence in its latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.Biosecurity (11:45 a.m.)China plans to ramp up the construction and management of biosecurity labs to prepare for future emerging diseases, while it also grapples with allegations from the U.S. that the coronavirus outbreak could have resulted from a lab leak.The country seeks to ''comprehensively enhance biosecurity governance capabilities'' by improving its monitoring and emergence preparedness, according to a document outlining major policy priorities through 2025. The report was released Friday as lawmakers from the world's second-largest economy meet in Beijing for the annual parliamentary session.More Oversight of Ant? (11:30 a.m.)China plans to step up oversight of financial holding companies and the nation's booming fintech industry, Premier Li Keqiang said, setting the tone for closer scrutiny over the next five years of behemoths including Jack Ma's Ant Group Co.The authorities will also expand an anti-monopoly crackdown and prevent the ''unregulated'' expansion of capital to create fair competition, Li said Friday at the opening of the National People's Congress. The fintech sector should be developed in a ''prudent'' manner and China aims to create a ''deviation correction'' mechanism to fix and suspend innovative financial products when needed, according to a separate plan covering policies for 2021 to 2025.China's s are walking a fine line of trying to curb risks at home while encouraging local champions as the economy opens wider to foreign capital. Fintech has become the latest target of scrutiny since the nation's leaders pledged in 2017 to clean up threats to its $53 trillion financial industry, tackling property loans, opaque wealth management products and fraud-riddled peer-to-peer lending.Overhauling H.K. Electoral System (11:16 a.m.)China is curbing the ability of democracy activists to win elections in Hong Kong, with local reports saying a vote for the territory's legislature would be delayed another year to September 2022.The National People's Congress will review a draft resolution on changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in the coming days, according to an agenda published Thursday by the official Xinhua News Agency. For weeks Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials have called for ''patriots'' to run Hong Kong, effectively signaling that anybody deemed disloyal to Beijing couldn't hold a leadership position.Carrie Lam at the opening ceremony of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesSeparately, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the city will amend local election legislation after China's top legislative body passes new election rules for the city's leader and lawmakers. The amendments will be tabled at the legislature for vetting, the principle of ''patriots ruling Hong Kong'' is fully in line with constitutional requirements of the city and ''One Country, Two Systems'' will be placed in jeopardy if forces that oppose China and stir up trouble in Hong Kong enter the political system via elections, she said.Tackling Housing (11:02 a.m.)China pledged to solve the housing problem in large cities at its top legislative session, as monetary loosening after the pandemic spurred a rush to real estate in the biggest hubs, pushing home affordability there to the worst ever.''We will address prominent housing issues in large cities,'' Premier Li Keqiang said. Li echoed President Xi Jinping's mantra that houses are ''for living in, not for speculation'' in the key report, signaling that policy makers may maintain a tight rein on the bubble-prone sector. ''We will keep the prices of land and housing as well as market expectations stable,'' he said.Boosting Usage of Non-Fossil Fuels (10:52 a.m.)In its 14th 5-year plan released Friday, China said it plans non-fossil fuels to account for 20% of energy use by 2025, versus 15% at the end of 2019. The country is also targeting it nuclear power capacity to increase about 40% to 70 gigawatts by 2025.China will also boost oil-and-gas exploration, expand its gas pipeline network, improve coal transportation and increase its ability to ensure supply.More Charging Stations for Electric Cars (10:40 a.m.)China aims to boost auto sales and add more charging facilities for electric vehicles this year. The government will encourage ''steady increases'' in spending on cars and ''abolish excessive restrictions'' on the sale of used vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. More car parks, EV charging stations and battery-swapping facilities will be built, and battery recycling systems developed at a faster pace, Li said.Premier Calls for Breakthroughs in Core Tech (10:29 a.m.)In his address Friday, Premier Li Keqiang outlined steps the government will take to make China into a global tech power. That includes building more national laboratories and innovation centers, as well as ramping up efforts to implement a little-heard of program called the Sci-Tech Innovation 2030 Agenda. Li also said China's R&amp;D spending will increase by more than 7% per year, which ''is expected to account for a higher percentage of GDP'' than during the previous five-year plan.Defense Budget Growth Fastest in Two Years (10:20 a.m.)China's defense spending is expected to grow 6.8% this year to 1.35 trillion yuan ($208 billion), according a budget report released today. That would be the fastest pace in two years. ''We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations,'' Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report.Boosting Trade with U.S. Allies (10:05 a.m.)China may join an Asia-Pacific trade pact comprised of key U.S. allies that former President Donald Trump exited, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. In his work report, Li said Beijing ''will actively consider joining'' the 11-nation agreement known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It includes nations that China has sparred with recently such as Australia, Canada and Japan.China Stocks Fall 10% From Recent Peak (9:59 a.m.)A screen displays a live news broadcast of Li Keqiang speaking at the National People's Congress in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Qilai Shen/BloombergChinese markets opened as Premier Li Keqiang was delivering his work report at the NPC and continued their recent slide, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index dropping as much as 2% at the start of trading. That put the index down 10% from a peak reached on Feb. 10. The rout has come amid growing concern that Beijing will begin to tighten liquidity conditions as the country's economy recovers from the effects of the coronavirus.Cuts in Carbon Emissions (09:43 a.m.)China will devise a plan for carbon emissions to peak by 2030 and is targeting an 18% cut per unit of GDP by 2025, according to Premier Li's work report. The nation will also aim for a 3% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP in 2021 and a 13.5% reduction by 2025.Tencent's Pony Ma Makes Proposals (09:16 a.m.)Tencent founder and Chief Executive Pony Ma, who is an NPC delegate, is attending this year's event in Beijing and submitted a proposal for better preserving China's natural resources. Ma's whereabouts have attracted attention after he skipped last year's NPC and was also absent from several major Tencent events due to health reasons.China Sets Modest GDP Target for 2021 (09:00 a.m.)China set a conservative economic growth target of above 6% for the year, well below what economists forecast, and outlined ongoing fiscal support to keep the country's recovery going. Other key economic targets include:Fiscal deficit target set at 3.2% of GDP for 2021, versus 3.6% in 2020CPI target set at 3% for 2021, versus around 3.5% in 2020Target for new urban job creation set at 11 million in 2021, versus 9 million in 2020Special government bond quota set at 3.65 trillion yuan in 2021, versus 3.75 trillion yuan in 2020©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>China's Record 5G Blueprint for 2021 Electrifies Telecom Stocks</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China unveiled plans to almost double its fifth-generation wireless capacity next year, sending ZTE Corp. and other network gear makers soaring.Carriers from China Mobile Ltd. to China Telecom Corp. will build upwards of 600,000 base stations to accelerate 5G coverage across major cities, Minister of Industry and Information Technology Xiao Yaqing said at an industry event according to the Xinhua News Agency. The envisioned rollout will come on top of at least 718,000 stations nationwide that transmit and amplify mobile signals.China began this year to put in place the world's largest and most sophisticated 5G network in a $1.4 trillion rollout of technology infrastructure it hopes will boost the world's No. 2 economy and underpin everything from autonomous vehicles to AI. Huawei Technologies Co. and its smaller rivals are expected to reap the lion's share of that largesse while foreign providers such as Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj struggle to win contracts. Network construction is also expected to lift adjacent sectors such as semiconductors.ZTE jumped as much as 9.1% in Hong Kong, while Datang Telecom Technology soared as much as 8%. Peers Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies Co., Wuhan Fingu Electronic Technology Co. and Suzhou Shijia Science &amp; Technology surged by their 10% daily limits on Chinese exchanges. Major telecom operators including China Mobile, China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. and China Telecom, which have yet to announce their 2021 capital spending plans for 5G construction, fell between 0.7% and 2.7%. The carriers are expected to incur surging costs in maintaining an expanding network, while revenues from commercial 5G packages have yet to recover their capital input.Read more: China Has a New $1.4 Trillion Plan to Overtake U.S. in TechBeijing is accelerating its bid for global leadership in key technologies. In a masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China is calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei to lay 5G networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software over the six years to 2025 that will underpin automated factories and mass surveillance. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>TikTok's CEO Quits Months Into the Job After Trump's Ban</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mayer has resigned just months after taking the helm of the viral short video app, stepping out of the crossfire as the Trump administration targets the business owned by China's ByteDance Ltd. Mayer told employees of his decision in an internal memo and a company spokeswoman confirmed his resignation. Vanessa Pappas, currently general manager of ByteDance's prized international service, will take his place. Mayer's departure adds to the turmoil engulfing the world's largest startup, which is grappling with the forced sale of operations in the U.S., possible restrictions in the U.K. and an outright ban in India, TikTok's largest market. ByteDance appointed Mayer in May to try and smooth relations with Washington, attempting to make the case that TikTok operates as a separate entity from its Beijing-based parent to assuage concerns about national security. Yet mere months later, the Trump administration forbade U.S. dealings with the viral video app and ordered its sale. That impending ban cast TikTok into the heart of worsening tensions between Beijing and Washington, which has leveled sanctions against a plethora of its fellow Chinese giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Huawei Technologies Co. &quot;In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,&quot; Mayer said in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &quot;I understand that the role that I signed up for -- including running TikTok globally -- will look very different as a result of the U.S. administration's action to push for a sell off of the U.S. business.&quot; The executive left one of the top jobs at The Walt Disney Co. for TikTok. For more than a decade, he helped the world's largest entertainment company strategize and expand its offerings. He provided the rationale for acquiring Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, and the entertainment assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. for $71 billion in March. A representative for the White House didn't respond to a request for comment on Mayer's departure, which the Financial Times first reported. Mayer &quot;tried to reposition himself to ride the mobile content wave,&quot; said Rich Greenfield at LightShed. &quot;Unfortunately, the Trump administration appears to have made that impossible.&quot; Read more: Kevin Mayer, Bob Iger's Right-Hand Man at Disney Mayer's role had been in question for weeks. Hired to run TikTok's global operations, Mayer was instead pulled into a likely breakup of the business. Microsoft Corp. has confirmed it's in negotiations to buy TikTok's operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, while Oracle Corp. is also considering a bid, Bloomberg News has reported. Large venture capital and private equity firms including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic have billions of dollars on the line and are now angling for the best deal. On Thursday, ByteDance's founder sought to reassure employees of the Chinese startup, which also operates AI-driven news service Toutiao and TikTok's Chinese cousin Douyin. In an internal memo, the 37-year-old coder-by-training appeared to acknowledge the convulsions within his company, thanking workers for &quot;shutting out the noise&quot; and getting on with the job. &quot;We are working quickly to find resolutions to the issues that we face globally, particularly in the U.S. and India,&quot; ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming said in a separate memo obtained by Bloomberg announcing Mayer's resignation. Mayer's departure comes days after TikTok asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom. TikTok and its Chinese parent sued on Monday in federal court in Los Angeles to challenge an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok. Trump says TikTok is a security risk for user data. The company said the president's decision was made &quot;for political reasons,&quot; is unconstitutional and violates rights to due process. On Aug. 14, Trump ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets and said the U.S. should receive a cut of the proceeds. Other bidders potentially interested in the assets include Twitter Inc. The social media company is among U.S. tech firms that have explored possible bids, though it's unclear how far those talks have gone, according to multiple people familiar with the deliberations. &quot;We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin's role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision,&quot; the TikTok spokeswoman said in a separate statement.

        <h4>Useless Machine Learning</h4>
        <div>
            Design Useful ML by Addressing Moments of Trust. Brødtekst TL, DR - Many ML applications are useful in theories, but they become useless in practice.Let's look at a real case study, highlight two types of biases, and how can understanding Moments of Trust can help with a concrete example. Finally, I leave you with 3 small actions to consider. The Story My inner voice : &quot;Is she having an affair? She must be. F*ck me!&quot; You can't blame me for having such thought when your beautiful wife suddenly spent so many nights away from home - she never had to work so much. So, I asked : &quot;What's going on? How come you seem so busy lately? Is everything okay?&quot; Jess : &quot;I don't know why you guys keep making these useless AI things , again ! They keep making us do more work.&quot; Well, I totally didn't see that coming. And ouch. As a loving husband, the right thing to do was to give her a hug and take on additional housework (yes, I did that.) More importantly, I needed to listen - well, for the sake of satisfying my selfish curiosity, the pursuit to better my own work, and the advancement of our ML community. So, I probed : &quot;Tell me more. What happened? Why do you say that?&quot; Two Types of Biases &amp; A Different Question J ess continued : &quot;We got this new Next Best Action app [an ML application]. Every week, it gives us a list of customers to call and product to offer. It's so damn useless I look at the list, I work with most of the customers, I know they won't buy the product  it's a waste of time, but we still have to do it to make our KPI look good. &quot; Jess just described two unique problems that every ML application faces. Let's unpack them: 1. Machine Bias . The machine is wrong, we, humans, are right. Machine Learning models aren't and can't be perfect - even we hope and perceive them to be. Humans see lots of data as we go about our day-to-day work, and subsequently, internalize it as intuition and knowledge, but such data may not be collected or represented properly in databases. As a result, the machine can't analyze fully and make better predictions with it. 2. Human Bias . The machine is right, we are wrong. Humans subject to Overconfidence Bias . In other words, we usually overestimate the accuracy of our predictions, especially in our domain of expertise. Perhaps, the machine actually knows more and up-to-date information than we do, so it produces better predictions. But we trust ourselves more than the machine. Many of us in the ML community may immediately ask: how can we fix the machine (e.g. the models)? Companies are hiring better data science talents, putting more rigorous ML Ops practices in place, and upgrading to better tools . But, doing these only solves the machine bias problem. A chain is as strong as the weakest link: the users of ML applications. We can't eliminate innate human biases, but we can design for trust With trust, users are more open to collaborating with machines. So, How might we foster trust between users and ML applications? - this is the question we should ask instead. Let's walk through a specific example and discuss how we can design for trust with Moment of Trust analysis and simple UX techniques Moments of Trust Caveat: the example below is inspired by Jess's work as a frontline who need to service clients in person. Although it focuses on one use case, the principles apply to many processes where humans need to take information from ML apps and decide how to act. To get a clearer and more specific picture of the problems, first, we should take a look at the Moments of Trust - the split seconds when humans need to make a judgement call based on their trust in the machines. We can highlight these moments by using a User Journey analysis Imagine when you go to a branch of a bank and meet with an advisor, here is a typical journey from the lens of advisor - the user of an ML application: Understanding the Moments of Trust helps us to find the specific pressure points when users might struggle with predictions from ML systems. Let's unpack the problems of each Moment of Trust reveals. Deeper Problems &amp; Solutions Moment of Trust #1 : Let's look at Step 4. This is the moment when the users see the predictions, understand what the predictions mean, and decide if they should and how to act. Problems: Users don't act upon the predictions. Typically, users see a simple description of what to offer or to do (see illustration on the left). When users need to decide if they want to follow, either they take a blind faith or lean towards their judgements of the moment. We tend to choose the latter given our Overconfidence Bias In other words, many predictions - the ones that Data Scientists spend hearts and souls creating - never really &quot;go into the market&quot;, they just flash on the users' screens, then disappear. This leads to two additional problems. First, user-machine interaction will be captured as &quot;failed&quot; in the database for the wrong reason. The machine thinks the interaction failed because of mathematical mistakes, but in reality, it failed because users didn't act or did it properly. Second, when the machines learn, they learn the wrong reality. This is known as the feedback loop problem (we will discuss below). As a result, it creates vicious loops of producing non-sensible predictions and ultimately ruins the trust of users. These are not prediction problems. They are UX problems. Goals: The main goals for this step should be two folds: 1) increase the percentage of action taken and 2) improve the quality of the action. Solutions: With this in mind, I propose to replace out-of-context suggestions with a contextual prompt . The contextual prompt should highlight the &quot;why&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, and &quot;how&quot; of executing an ML prediction with human-readable language (illustration on the left) . Depends on the type of algorithm, there are various ways to translate machine decisions into human-readable language. Problems: Users can't provide good feedback. Typically, this interface allows users to track their progress and coordinate with other members, however, it's often not designed to capture feedback for the ML apps (the users are also not incentivized to do so). As mentioned previously, a broken or poor feedback loop creates problems for ML models to learn from mistakes. Just like humans, good feedback allows us to learn better and faster. Goals: At this step, the main goal is to encourage users to share better feedback, for themselves and the machines. Solutions : The simplest solution is to use UI elements that are familiar to most people, these UI elements can help to standardize inputs and shorten the time to input information. In addition to offering a UX for capturing feedback, the ML app can also share how it uses the feedback to improve future predictions. This can create a sense of participation and reward for the users. Note: all screenshots are cleansed for confidentiality. They represent common elements from organizations with similar applications. One Step At A Time In fact, the &quot;useless ML experience&quot; is a recurring theme. Jess and I experienced a similar issue on a different occasion. As I described in The Last Mile Problems of AI , it comes down to a disconnection in human-AI collaboration . Solving the problem requires an integrated approach to address issues on three fronts. What happens if we don't solve this problem? Everyone will be upset if we don't solve the trust problem. Users like Jess will keep complaining about how useless &quot;AI things&quot; are and not benefit from amazing technologies because of self-biases, data scientists may lose their jobs because the real results of the models will never match the wishful estimations, businesses will never actualize the promise values of AI, most importantly, I will have to keep listening to Jess, my friends in data science, and my clients complaining about each other. There are many steps we need to take to build useful ML applications. Designing for Trust is a great, and simple, first step. Take action now. Suggested Actions identify a user-facing ML use case at your company incorporate the User Journey and Moment of Trust analysis into your ML design workflow host a collaborative design session based on the Moment of Trust with representatives from data science, engineering, and user group (e.g. frontline). Conclusion Many ML apps are deemed to be useless by users, not because of the accuracy of predictions, but because of human biases. It's our responsibility to design for trust as designers and developers of ML applications. The solutions often are simple.

        <h4>PRM / Hitachi and Centre Léon Bérard cancer center in Lyon to launch a research collaboration in the fight against cancer with AI</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra Hitachi Medical Systems Europe Holding AGLyonHitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501, &quot;Hitachi&quot;) and Centre Léon Bérard (CLB), a leading French Comprehensive Cancer Center in Lyon-France, announced today that they have entered into an agreement to jointly promote research and development aimed at improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of cancer and established a new research laboratory called Hitachi Lyon Lab on the CLB site, starting November 5th.In this collaboration, Hitachi and CLB will conduct research and development of novel technologies to detect and diagnose cancers exploiting medical images such as CT/MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and to predict response to radiation therapy using tumor genomic and transcriptomic data.According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Japan has the largest number of CTs and MRIs per million people. With the improvements of diagnostic imaging equipment, the number of images read by radiologists is increasing, and technologies that reduce the burden on radiologists using artificial intelligence are being actively developed. In addition, as a result of dramatic progress in gene analysis technology in recent years, it has become possible to analyse individual genome information at low cost, and personalized medicine that provides medical care suitable for each individual has been a key concern mainly in developed countries.Hitachi provides solutions that improve the quality and efficiency of medical care, from diagnostic/clinical fields such as diagnostic imaging equipment and particle therapy systems to informatics fields such as IT and AI. In addition, Hitachi has been contributing to maintaining and improving people's quality of life by delivering particle therapy systems to a number of world-renowned hospitals, where more than 60,000 people have been treated with Hitachi's systems so far.CLB is a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Lyon - Auvergne-Rh&amp;ocirc,ne-Alpes region, France, whose missions are care, research and education. It is affiliated to UNICANCER, the French Comprehensive Cancer Centers federation, counting twenty other cancer centers. CLB provides state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients such as innovative therapies and radiation therapy. Images, as well as molecular data from tumors, are collected and stored overtime for research purpose, upon consent from patients.Hitachi and CLB will conduct joint research at Hitachi Lyon Lab to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of cancer, by combining CLB's clinical expertise  and patient data related to cancer treatment with Hitachi's know-how in diagnostic imaging and IT/AI. Specifically, they will jointly develop diagnostic imaging technologies to detect potential cancer sites and assist radiologists' diagnosis from image data such as CT and MRI using AI. Identification of biomarkers exploiting genomic data in the context of resistance will allow to predict responses and prognoses upon radiation treatment.Hitachi will continue to accelerate global R&amp;D with advanced medical institutions and universities in the healthcare field, and will work with partners in joint research to create new value and contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of care.Kontakt:Contact:

        <h4>China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence in its latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang singled out key areas in which to achieve ''major breakthroughs in core technologies,'' including high-end semiconductors, operating systems, computer processors and cloud computing -- areas in which American firms now hold sway. Beijing will also aim to get 56% of the country on faster fifth-generation or 5G networks. Nationwide R&amp;D spending will increase by more than 7% annually, which ''is expected to account for a higher percentage of GDP'' than during the previous five years, he added.WATCH: What is China's aiming for with its technology push?(Source: Quicktake)China is moving quickly to cut its dependence on the West for crucial components like computer chips, an issue that became more urgent after a global shortage of semiconductors worsened during the pandemic. Beijing is also making big bets on emerging technologies from hydrogen vehicles to biotech while looking to ensure its own chipmakers can compete with the likes of Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That encompasses a new emphasis on silicon design software and so-called third-generation chipmaking -- two areas critical to Beijing's drive to achieve technology self-sufficiency.''Innovation remains at the heart of China's modernization drive,'' Li said in an address to the National People's Congress in Beijing on Friday. ''We will strengthen our science and technology to provide strategic support for China's development.''Li's speech punctuated goals enumerated in China's 14th five-year plan, also released Friday, which prioritized advances in younger spheres such as quantum computing, neural networks and DNA banks. The document enshrines alayered strategy both pragmatic and ambitious in scope, embracing aspirations to replace pivotal U.S. suppliers and fend off Washington, while molding homegrown champions in emergent fields.Chipmakers including Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co. and China Resources Microelectronics Ltd. rose more than 3% on mainland bourses in the afternoon. But Hong Kong-listed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's largest chipmaker, slipped in tandem with a broader global tech-shares selloff.Read more: China Sets Conservative Economic Growth Target of Above 6%At stake is nothing less than the future of the world's No. 2 economy. Beijing is moving swiftly while the Biden administration escalates a battle against what it called ''techno-autocracies.'' That could extend or even expand blacklistings that banned key transactions with corporations from Huawei Technologies Co. to ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.To a country that imports $300 billion of chips annually, a worsening global shortage drives home the risk of relying on potentially hostile suppliers for the building blocks of everything from AI to next-generation networks and autonomous vehicles. Friday's report formalized China's ambitions to develop its own software for semiconductor design -- supplanting tools from American firms Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.It also pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing technologies and key materials that comprise third-generation chips. The country aims to secure first-mover advantage in that nascent arena, involving compounds such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride and chips can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, with broad applications in fifth-generation radio frequency chips, military-grade radar and electric vehicles.While specifics of that endeavor won't emerge for months, Friday's documents provided important clues about the envisioned . That includes building more national laboratories and innovation centers, as well as ramping up efforts to implement a little-heard of program called the Sci-Tech Innovation 2030 Agenda. Beijing also revealed plans to try and entice more talent from abroad via a ''technology immigration system,'' likely targeting semiconductor hotbeds from Silicon Valley to Taiwan.Read more: China Deals Fresh Blow to Tech Giants in Reach for DataOpen sharing of data will be key, according to the report. Beijing is establishing a platform for sharing public and government data, while simultaneously crafting policies to ensure the security of that information. In a related move, the five-year plan called on technology giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to share key data, dealing a further blow to companies already reeling from heightened antitrust scrutiny.''Basic research is the wellspring of scientific and technological innovation,'' Li said. ''So we will ensure the stable functioning of funding mechanism for basic research and boost spending in this area by a considerable sum.''(Updates with share action from the sixth paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>China Tech Giants Spend Billions to Fuel Growth After Crackdown</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Beijing's crackdown on its tech giants is fueling a noticeable phenomenon: it's opened the spending floodgates.China's largest internet corporations are digging deep into their pockets to open up new avenues of growth as Beijing curtails their most lucrative businesses from fintech to e-commerce. Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan have all warned investors in recent weeks they're prepared to open their coffers to expand in areas such as cloud computing, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. The coming deluge promises to transform the internet landscape by funneling capital into fundamental technology and infrastructure -- not coincidentally priority areas for the Communist Party.Of the three, Beijing-based Meituan was the earliest to throw caution to the wind and also the one most accustomed to sacrificing profits. The food delivery giant sank into the red in the December quarter and warned of further losses, as founder Wang Xing boosted spending on logistics networks and supply chain capacity to bolster his new online grocery ambitions. In April, it raised a record $10 billion to develop advanced solutions such as autonomous delivery vehicles and robotics, days before China's monopoly watchdog unveiled a probe into the corporation for alleged antitrust violations.Meituan, the country's third-biggest tech corporation by market value, is set to report its March-quarter earnings on Friday. Revenue is expected to reach 35.7 billion yuan ($5.6 billion), rebounding from last year's pandemic-era lows, while net loss is projected to more than double from the December quarter to 5.2 billion yuan, according to estimates.''The increased investment for the tech giants is not really something they have a choice over,'' said He Qi, a fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management. ''The point of the antitrust campaign is in effect to drive these behemoths out of their comfort zone, where they are now just basically rent-seeking off their unchallenged position in their respective businesses.''The flood of spending comes after the months-long antitrust campaign wiped out hundreds of billions in value from the country's largest tech firms. After scuppering fintech giant Ant Group Co.'s initial public offering and launching a probe into affiliate Alibaba last year, regulators have since introduced new rules governing competition, fintech and data collection. Authorities are also said to be considering setting up a joint venture to oversee the massive amounts of user data collected by private companies.Those efforts are likely to limit the once-freewheeling internet industry's ability to squash competition, either by buying up promising startups or squeezing out rivals through tactics like forced exclusivity or predatory pricing. The antitrust watchdog in April levied a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba and ordered its 34 largest tech corporations to pledge compliance with regulations.Days later, it announced its probe into Meituan for alleged abuses including forced exclusivity agreements known as ''pick one from two,'' the same charge leveled against Alibaba. China's food delivery giant has also been accused of exploiting workers, while its community commerce arm was fined for excessive subsidies.Wang's post of a millennium-old poem, seen by some as a veiled critique of Beijing, added to jitters. Meituan has lost nearly 40% of its market value, more than $130 billion, since its peak in February. The stock sank more than 3% in Hong Kong trading Thursday.The online behemoths have responded to the antitrust push by pledging to funnel future earnings into new initiatives. Jack Ma's flagship e-commerce firm said earlier this month it will invest ''all incremental profit'' into technology as well as areas like community commerce in an attempt to move past the antitrust probe. In Tencent's case, it promised to invest a bigger portion of profits into sectors like cloud and short videos, and even earmarked billions for so-called ''social value'' -- a clear sop to Beijing.''Deep tech is a priority set by the government and Chinese Internet companies are fully aware of it,'' said Shawn Yang, an analyst with research firm Blue Lotus Capital.Even before the antitrust crackdown began in earnest last November, technology giants have been adding to investments, albeit in fields like community commerce. Alibaba challenger Pinduoduo Inc. raised $6.1 billion in November to grow its online groceries and agricultural produce businesses. Executives on Wednesday reiterated plans to invest ''heavily'' in areas like logistics infrastructure and technology, after reporting quarterly sales more than tripled.Rivals from Didi to smaller startups like Tencent-backed MissFresh also piled into community commerce, all seeking to take the lead in a market forecast to reach $19 billion this year.Read more: Alibaba, Meituan Chase $14 Billion Group-Buyers Arena''We're getting to the point where the space is getting crowded,'' Jason Hsu, founder and chief executive officer of Rayliant Global , said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television. ''Everyone is moving roughly in the same direction whether you are Meituan, Pinduoduo, Alibaba or Tencent. You're all eyeing about the same space.''In March, Premier Li Keqiang singled out key areas in which to achieve ''major breakthroughs in core technologies,'' including high-end semiconductors, computer processors and cloud computing -- areas in which American firms now hold sway. Leaders in Beijing have also pledged to drive research into artificial intelligence and faster fifth-generation networks.Instead of getting obsessed with a new service, ''internet giants with immense data and advanced algorithms should shoulder greater responsibility, aim higher and do more in tech innovation,'' the People's Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, said in a December commentary.Meituan, for its part, has been cultivating autonomous delivery, with more than 35,000 grocery orders being delivered so far in Beijing and said it plans to invest part of the $10 billion raised last month into drone technology.''The Chinese government expects domestic internet giants to play a bigger role in helping the country achieve tech self-sufficiency,'' said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson &amp; Co. ''After all, advancing fundamental technologies require massive capital and manpower. In a country which still lacks a mature venture investment ecosystem, deep-pocketed big tech is in a better position than startups to lead that breakthrough.''(Updates with Meituan shares in eighth paragraph, Pinduoduo comments on investment in 12th paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>SoftBank Founder Tells Wall Street He's Eager to Keep Investing</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp., facing skepticism of its investment strategy, conveyed a message to Wall Street on Monday: Now is the time to invest. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder and chief executive officer, told a roomful of fund managers and financial institutions at a private meeting in New York that recent market declines present an opportunity to invest in companies at discounted valuations, according to people who attended. He also argued that SoftBank is well-positioned to pick the winners. Son highlighted Arm Ltd., whose technology is the basis of most of the world's smartphone processors, as an effective bet for SoftBank, despite intensifying scrutiny about the British company's losses. For the last month, SoftBank has been trying to manage a campaign from an activist investor. Elliott Management Corp., the New York-based investment firm, amassed a stake in SoftBank worth nearly $3 billion and outlined recommendations that it says would lift the company's share price. They include increasing oversight of SoftBank's Vision Fund, selling stock holdings and using the proceeds to buy back SoftBank shares. Monday's event, hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. at the Lotte New York Palace hotel, gave investors a venue to pose questions to Son, the 62-year-old Japanese billionaire. Attendees were asked to email their queries to a Goldman Sachs moderator, who filtered and selected which ones to ask, according to attendees, who requested anonymity because the meeting was private. A spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment. Son pledged to start &quot;listening more&quot; to independent directors and shareholders. He said as the company's largest shareholder, nobody wants to see the stock price rise as much as he does. The company's market value is about $100 billion, less than half of what SoftBank has said it should be worth. SoftBank plans to forge ahead with a scaled-down Vision Fund II, Son reiterated at the meeting. He expects 2020 and 2021 to be the &quot;best vintage&quot; for the Vision Fund, according to one of the people in the room. He predicted that about 15% of Vision Fund companies would go bust, while another 15% would account for 90% of profits. Son expressed regret about overpaying for stock in WeWork, the beleaguered co-working company. But he advised the room to &quot;expect great things&quot; from WeWork parent We Co. in the next one to three years. Son also said SoftBank would seek to stop investing in companies that compete with one another, as it has done in ride hailing, food delivery and other industries. Despite these setbacks, Son said he remains convinced in his investment thesis that artificial intelligence will disrupt all industries. He said he plans to continue backing financial, medical and transportation companies, among those in other industries, that are driving what he describes as an &quot;information revolution.&quot; --With assistance from Sarah McBride.

        <h4>The EU should regulate AI on the basis of rights, not risks</h4>
        <div>
          EU vil have virksomheder til at evaluere deres operationelle risici op imod grundlæggende menneskerettigheder. Det er en grundlæggende misforståelse af, hvad menneskerettigheder er, skriver repræsentanter fra Acces Now i dette synspunkt.BrødtekstIn only a few months the European Commission is set to present a regulation on artificial intelligence (AI). Despite numerous statements from civil society and other actors about the dangers of applying a risk-based approach to regulating AI, the European Commission seems determined to go in this direction. The Commission already said in its 2020 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence that it wanted to apply a risk-based approach.A risk-based approach involves determining the scale or scope of risks related to a concrete situation and a recognised threat. This approach is useful in technical environments where companies have to evaluate their own operational risks. However, the EU approach would have companies evaluate their operational risks vs. people's fundamental rights. This is a fundamental misconception of what human rights are, they cannot be put in a balance with companies' interests. Companies would also have an interest in downplaying the risks in order to develop products. A risk-based approach to regulation is therefore not adequate to protect human rights. Our rights are non-negotiable and they must be respected regardless of a risk level associated with external factors.We have heard people make numerous references to how a risk-based approach would take its lead from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is worrying precisely because the GDPR is not fundamentally a risk-based law, and the parts that deal with risk assessment have proven highly problematic.As we explain below, the upcoming legislative proposal on AI should be a rights-based law, like the GDPR, as this is the only way to ensure the protection of fundamental rights. The European Commission must not compromise our rights by substituting a mere risk mitigation exercise by the very actors with a vested interest in rolling out this technology.Why the GDPR is not a risk-based lawThroughout the negotiations of the GDPR and since its adoption in 2016, many in industry have claimed that the law ''enshrines'' or ''establishes'' a risk-based approach to data protection. That is not the case.The GDPR does include references to risks and defines the requirements for conducting a risk assessment in specific scenarios, such as when there is a data breach. However, the GDPR is based on rights and making them operational. It sets out a series of rights to enable us to control our information and then places obligations and requirements on companies and other entities that use our data, to protect those rights. In fact, during the negotiations of the GDPR, the Working Party 29 - which gathers all EU data protection authorities - published a statement on the risk-based approach to explain that it cannot replace company obligations to protect our rights:''the Working Party is concerned that both in relation to discussions on the new EU legal framework for data protection and more widely, the risk-based approach is being increasingly and wrongly presented as an alternative to well-established data protection rights and principles, rather than as a scalable and proportionate approach to compliance. The purpose of this statement is to set the record straight.''The statement further clarifies that ''rights granted to the data subject by EU law should be respected regardless of the level of the risks which the latter incur through the data processing involved''. The data protection authorities have not since changed their opinion on the matter. The guidelines the European Data Protection Board recently issued confirm that the risk-based approach under the GDPR is limited to a few articles and clarifies that other obligations continue to apply.The development of AI and automated decision-making (ADM) systems poses great risks to fundamental rights. There is mounting evidence to show how these systems can violate our rights. We are seeing the use of live facial recognition systems in public spaces that amounts to mass surveillance , the deployment of publicly funded pseudoscientific AI ''lie detector'' systems along national borders, the use of biased, problematic ADM systems to detect welfare fraud , and even use of relatively basic ADM systems that entrench and amplify inequality in grading students.The fact that AI systems can operate in unpredictable ways, and that systems that ostensibly perform ''simple'' or routine tasks can end up having unforeseen and often highly damaging consequences, deepens the risks. A good example is the use of automated gender recognition technology, where machine learning systems are trained to ''detect'' someone's gender from facial or other characteristics. While such systems are widespread and usually considered trivial, they have been shown to systematically discriminate against trans and gender non-conforming people by either misgendering them or forcibly assigning them a gender identity that does not match their true gender identity.From a fundamental rights perspective, these two considerations - the evidence that there is a threat to our rights, and that AI and ADM systems can act in unpredictable ways - should lead to a proposal for a proper human rights impact assessment by independent experts and regulators, both ex ante and on a regular basis once the systems are in use. Unfortunately that is not what the European Commission proposed in its communication on the upcoming AI regulations.Rather than focusing on fundamental rights, the Commission's stated approach to regulating AI has been to place innovation and increased AI uptake as its primary concern. Protecting rights is acknowledged as a secondary concern, with the worrying proviso that it must only be done in a manner that does not risk stifling innovation.This insistence on protecting innovation and increasing AI uptake at all costs seems to be one of the main motivations behind the proposal to adopt a risk-based approach to regulation. The Commission's White Paper on Artificial Intelligence lays the groundwork for this approach by proposing distinguishing between high- and low-risk AI systems. In addition, a study commissioned by the European Parliament's Panel for the Future of Science and Technology (STOA), The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on artificial intelligence, envisions a ''risk-based approach, [which] rather than granting individual entitlements, focuses on creating a sustainable ecology of information, where harm is prevented by appropriate organisational and technological measures''.How would such an approach work? The Commission's White Paper proposes using two cumulative criteria to assess risk, ''considering whether both the sector and the intended use involve significant risks, in particular from the viewpoint of protection of safety, consumer rights and fundamental rights'' (p.17). This suggests that to trigger regulatory protections, an AI system would need to be used in a sector identified as high risk (such as health) and ''used in such a manner that significant risks are likely to arise''. The White Paper leaves open the possibility that ''the use of AI applications for certain purposes is to be considered as high-risk as such'' and cites the use of AI in hiring and in remote biometric identification systems.Why a rights-based approach is the way to goIn our response to the consultation on the Commission's White Paper, we outlined the many problems with the risk-based approach it proposes. One clear issue is that dangerous applications that fall through the cracks and are wrongly classified as ''low risk'' will not be subject to proper oversight and safeguards. We therefore proposed that the burden of proof be on the entity wanting to develop or deploy the AI system to demonstrate that it does not violate human rights via a mandatory human rights impact assessment (HRIA). This requirement would be for all applications in all domains, and it should apply to both the public and private sector, as part of a broader due diligence framework.Once such an impact assessment has been conducted, there could then be a role for some form of risk assessment to define the consequences of that assessment. Regardless, we caution against taking a simplistic high-low risk binary approach, and further encourage the Commission to develop clear and coherent criteria to determine when an AI or ADM system has a significant effect on an individual, a specific group, or society at large.Most importantly, however, the Commission needs to account for the fact that even a ''high-risk'' classification will be inadequate for the danger posed by some uses of AI. With applications of AI such as remote biometric identification, automated gender ''detection'', and other forms of behavioural prediction, it is not a question of whether these applications of AI pose a ''risk'' to human rights, they are fundamentally incompatible with the enjoyment and protection of human rights. Framing the problem in terms of risk encourages the idea that we could introduce safeguards or ethical guidelines that would ''lower the risk''. In reality, some systems inherently undermine our rights and our dignity in a manner that cannot be mitigated.Together with 61 other civil society organisations in Europe, Access Now has called for the Commission to ensure that its regulatory proposal on AI makes provision for ''red lines'' or prohibitions on certain applications, such as those that would deepen structural discrimination, exclusion, and collective harms, or those that serve to restrict or grant discriminatory access to vital services such as health care and social security. Perhaps most urgently, our coalition is calling for a ban on biometric mass surveillance.We believe that the European Union can only live up to its promise of promoting ''trustworthy AI'' if it takes a rights-based approach and bans outright those applications of AI that are inherently incompatible with fundamental rights.

        <h4>Majority of Promising AI Startups Are Still Based in the U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- The most promising startups using artificial intelligence are U.S.-based companies working in the fields of health care, retail and transportation, according to a study that looked at budding AI companies around the world. Of the top 100 startups in AI, 65% were based in the U.S., though some of those had dual headquarters in China or elsewhere, according to the analysis by CB Insights, a tech research group that analyzed data on close to 5,000 startups around the world. &quot;These would be companies to watch that are doing really interesting research in AI,&quot; said Deepashri Varadharajan, the lead analyst on the report. &quot;Some of them might get acquired. Some might have successful product launches.&quot; The research group considered venture capital investment, patent activity and market potential to develop its list of the companies most likely to succeed. The high percentage of U.S.-based companies reflect the country's historical dominance in AI research, Varadharajan said. More than 4,300 startups in 80 countries have raised $83 billion since 2014, including $26.6 billion just last year, according to CB Insights. While the dollar figures for investment have grown rapidly, the share of U.S.-based investments dropped in that period to 39% from 71%. &quot;The U.S. still has the most number of deals, but that deal share has started to drop as other countries are starting to fund technologies,&quot; she said. &quot;The vast majority are automating specific tasks in white-collar settings.&quot; That echoes a Brookings Institution study last year that found white-collar jobs are most likely to see an impact from AI, particularly in the life sciences and computer industries. Top ranked firms in the CB Insights ranking included several unicorns, or startups whose private valuations reached $1 billion or more. These include the following: Butterfly Network, which is building an ultrasound device that uses AI-assisted diagnostics, Faire Wholesale Inc., which helps local retailers determine what goods are predicted to sell best in specific locations, and DataRobot, whose tools help companies develop their own AI applications. Some of the startups already have begun work with larger companies, including Caspar.AI, a U.S. and Japan-based firm that's working with Panasonic Corp. on smart home products and ClimaCell Inc., a climate-monitoring firm that's partnered with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. Google also is working with U.K.-based InstaDeep Ltd., which builds AI systems for other companies in the fields of logistics, energy and electronic design. What the companies have in common is that they are addressing a need within specific industries and, in many cases, breaking through bottlenecks, Varadharajan said. &quot;You can be using AI, that's great, but is there a problem that you're trying to solve?&quot; she said. &quot;It can be an industry-specific need or pushing the boundaries of core research itself.&quot; The health-care startups were looking at diagnostics, health monitoring and enhancing imaging. AI companies are working to develop commuter modeling, waste recycling and mapping for city planning. Improving the energy grid, anti-fraud features in the finance industry, and indoor farming are some of the other areas where AI is being used. Some future trends she pointed to include energy efficiency, improving quantum computing and doctored videos called deepfakes. --With assistance from Alex Tanzi.

        <h4>Billionaire Founder of China Property Giant Dies of Illness</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- The billionaire founder of KE Holdings Inc. has died of an unspecified illness, a shocking development for a Chinese property company that pulled off one of the strongest U.S. market debuts of 2020.Zuo Hui, who turned the company known as Beike from a nationwide chain of real estate offices into China's largest platform for housing transactions and services, died May 20 after an ''unexpected worsening of illness,'' his company said in a statement without elaborating. KE Holdings' board will announce follow-up arrangements within two weeks, it added.Zuo, 50, has been the driving force behind the company's success, headlining the bell-ringing ceremony when it went public and holding 81.1% of voting shares under a dual-class voting structure as of end-February, according to its annual report. The company's American depositary receipts fell 0.8% to $49.85 in New York on Thursday, paring an earlier decline of almost 10%.Zuo HuiPhotographer: Qilai Shen/BloombergZuo was backed by some of Asia's most influential startup investors, including Hillhouse Capital Group and Tencent Holdings Ltd., and ranks among SoftBank Group Corp.'s most successful bets. KE Holdings almost doubled on its August U.S. debut, vaulting Zuo into the ranks of the world's richest entrepreneurs with a fortune in excess of $20 billion at one point, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires' Index.Its shares were up 151% from their New York debut through Wednesday's close, conferring on the late chairman a net worth of $14.8 billion.In an interview with CCTV aired in April, he downplayed the significance of the IPO and the riches it bestowed.''Why should I excited?'' he said, dressed in jeans, a dark blue vest and black sneakers. ''This makes no difference to me.''Read more: Founder of China Property Site With No Profits Worth $20 BillionBorn in 1971 in Shaanxi province, Zuo graduated with a bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 1992 before getting into sales and establishing an insurance business, where he made his first fortune, according to local media. He then founded Beijing Lianjia Real Estate Brokerage Co. in 2001, when China's property market was still relatively young, and started Ziroom in 2011 to offer long-term apartment rentals. In 2018, he incorporated KE and launched Beike, becoming one of the country's most celebrated entrepreneurs.Beike uses artificial intelligence and big data to improve its service and provide market insights, according to its website. As of June, the company boasted 226 million homes on its platform and 39 million monthly active users on mobiles. That's swelled to more than 48 million mobile monthly active users and half a million agents.The platform also draws in others by allowing decorators, renovators and financial institutions to connect with buyers, creating an ecosystem of property and related offerings.(Updates with closing share price in third paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>What Do the Academy Awards, AWS and AI Have in Common?</h4>
        <div>
          Just take two little human mistakes that recently received worldwide attention because of the power of today's technology to magnify their impacts on a global scale.The first was the mistake made by a senior partner atPricewaterhouseCoopers, who was assigned to hand an envelope to an actor tasked to announce the best picture of the year. This is a task that has been performed flawlessly for decades. It is a job that has been practiced so often that a structured protocol has been established to ensure that it is handled seamlessly.Ah, but human error can occur at any point, and in this case it was caused by various distractions at the crucial moment when the handoff was scheduled to occur. Ironically, the senior partner, who probably behaves in a machine-like manner on most days, fell victim to the temptation of technology as he admitted that he was tweeting a picture at the precise time he was supposed to be handing the most important envelope to the last presenters of the evening.Amazon's CloudburstOnly a few days later, a technician working for Amazon Web Services inadvertently inputted the wrong instructions into the largest cloud provider's systems during the course of an otherwise routine maintenance process, and succeeded in knocking out a major portion of the AWS network. The simple mistake impacted countless companies and other organizations that rely on AWS to support their websites, e-commerce and other online activities.The error had a significant economic effect for those AWS customers and reignited questions of confidence regarding our over-reliance on cloud-based services. The irony in this case is that there may not be a more automated company on the planet than Amazon, and AWS has experienced unprecedented growth because of the power of its automated systems.So, do these events add more fuel to the argument that automation is a good thing that can eliminate human error and make our daily lives better and less susceptible to costly mistakes?Fourth Industrial RevolutionThe fundamental question about the value of automation has been perplexing politicians, policymakers, innovators, business leaders and the general public since the days of the first industrial revolution. Depending on how you count your technological waves, we're no closer to answering this question as we find ourselves in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution fueled by artificial intelligence and machine learning.No one can deny that the advent of automation has created greater efficiencies, along with exponential scalability that never could be matched by humans. However, even the smartest people at Tesla couldn't prevent its Autopilot-guided car from experiencing a fatal crash. Nor could Microsoft's AI wizards prevent its Tay chatbot from spewing inappropriate tweets.Now, plenty of people are lamenting that the accelerated pace of AI, ML and automated system deployment is calling into question what roles will be left for mere mortals.What's a Human to Do?The question about the proper balance between AI, ML and automation versus the human touch of real people is especially important in the rapidly changing world of customer experience and engagement. Because of the tremendous success of e-commerce, many companies and other organizations that interact with customers have set a frantic pace for adoption of the latest cloud and Internet of Things technologies to digitize their products, services and business environments.There is no denying that these new systems are creating more convenient on-demand solutions that in many cases are doing a better job of matching the products and services to meet customers'wants and needs with far less friction than their predecessors. However, as they remove the human factor from the equation, they also impersonalize the very things the technology promised to personalize in the process.Despite today's political rhetoric calling for a return to the old days, before people were replaced by machines and then watched their jobs shipped overseas, only the darkest vision of a world rid of innovation will derail the inevitable advancements of technology, automation and AI.Fortunately, there are lots of thought leaders who are working hard to paint a different picture of the future, and a growing number of real-world success stories suggest that it is possible. Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Glory Days&quot; may be gone, but a better balance can be achieved if we figure out new ways for humans and machines to collaborate with each other, rather than looking at this relationship as a zero-sum game.has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2009.

          Historic data is being used for the models that will work in the future. Our models stay static while the world changes constantly. Brødtekst If you work in academia, or in industry, you work on real-life problems. The data we work on are not synthetic, they are from the readings from the real world. While working in our offices, abstracted from the real-life events happening related to our projects, businesses, or challenges, we tend to lose the connection with the problems we are solving. It is easy to see the projects as numbers. Static numeric values, strings of characters, and meaningless IDs. We store them in binary, disconnected from the real world. In this setting, it is easy to forget that the real world is dynamic, and so are the data. The problem starts to arise when we neglect, or naively forget about this reality, and focus on our beloved KPIs. This story is about how our machine learning models stay static, while the data change day by day with the dynamic world. After I had an incident in one of the previous companies I worked for, I started to become a little bit obsessive about the continuity of my models' performance. In short, one of our models that was live and directly responsible for the output of a critical engine started to predict absurd results. The worst thing was that we did not discover something was wrong until we got angry phone calls from the client and spent long days to debug the entire pipeline before finding the root cause. The model was outputting extremely high or extremely low predictions. In retrospect, we found out that there were no faulty components in our stack. No bugs, no errors. The problem caused by the upstream data. The data that were consumed from upstream, the real-world readings, had changed. Models are Built by the Snapshot of the World If you are not employing some kind of online learning where models update themselves at regular intervals, you work on historic data. You consume some data from your data store and train your models. You constantly do this. You fetch the historic data, move it through the pipeline, get your model. The keyword here is historic. You work on data that are already old. You are building your solution for the future while looking at the past. With your data, you actually develop your solution on the snapshot of the world. The raw data, the real world readings represent the snapshot. This snapshot can be weeks, months, or years. The longer the snapshot the better. Still, this gives you no guarantee that the future will follow the same behavior that was in your snapshot. Models Fail When the World Changes When you work with historic data, you sign a contract with your model. You promise your model that the properties of the data will not change. In exchange, the model gives you an accurate description of history. You rely on your KPIs. Celebrate when you exceed a threshold. Push your solution into production. While the same model is still up there, your contract is still binding. The real-world changes constantly, and so do our upstream data. If you are not taking an additional step, your models will be ignorant of the changes. Your contract is still there. Following a change, when a major event happens, or slowly over time, your upstream data start to change. It may change so drastically that the upstream data may not resemble the historic data your model was trained on anymore at some point. At this point, you violate your contract, and your model starts to fail silently. Continuity of the Performance As the world change, and so does our data, we need to be sure that our model is still doing a good job. Even though we may not do anything to put the model on the right path, we need to know the performance. To make sure my models' performances are still satisfactory, I tend to put the following checks. Mind that these checks are in the service of the model/solution you are serving. 1. Upstream Data Checks For this one, you define which stage is upstream depending on your project. The idea is to observe the data at any stage before entering the model to make a prediction. While this is the case, probably the last stage of the data before they are fed into the model is a good stage. The idea in this check is to make sure the upstream data still resembles the distribution, or follow the same pattern, of the historic data used while training the model. A simple but powerful way could be calculating the distribution of the upstream data at every fixed time interval, and comparing it with the historic data's distribution. If the similarity between the two distributions is close, you are green. Otherwise, you raise an alert, and let the owner of the solution know. 2. Downstream Output Checks The idea behind the downstream check is very similar to the upstream data checks. Instead of checking the upstream, in this one, you check the output of your model or your service. Like the upstream check, you monitor the similarity between the distribution of the outputs of your model in production and the output of your model when fed with historic data. Monitor the similarity between two distributions, raise an alert if it starts to drift away. These two checks are simple to implement. You can put them in a real-time monitoring dashboard, or just send a mail to the owner of the repository when a threshold is exceeded. Like with any checks, it is good to know that they are there. If you are curious about the end of the incident I mentioned at the start of this story, let me continue. The change came from the client-side. Our readings were dependent on a complex and long list of configurations of frameworks that were running on the client-side. It was later apparent that the client changed some major configurations. This change was so impactful to our readings, it resulted in major shifts in the upstream data. As a result, the new data points fed into the model were completely different than the data we used for training. Only if we had some checks on the data, we could be aware of that change and could take some actions to put things in the right direction. Luckily this incident did not impact the business much and everything was back to normal in a couple of days. This valuable lesson made me a little more paranoid about the static nature of our models, and if my solutions still work as I expected in the production. Denne artikel var orginalt bragt på Medium

        <h4>Microsoft DoWhy is an Open Source Framework for Causal Reasoning</h4>
        <div>
            The framework explores causal relationships between different variables. The human mind has a remarkable ability to associate causes with a specific event.From the outcome of an election to an object dropping on the floor, we are constantly associating chains of events that cause a specific effect. Neuropsychology refers to this cognitive ability as causal reasoning. Computer science and economics study a specific form of causal reasoning known as causal inference which focuses on exploring relationships between two observed variables. Over the years, machine learning has produced many methods for causal inference but they remain mostly difficult to use in mainstream applications. Last year, Microsoft Research open sourced DoWhy , a framework for causal thinking and analysis which since then has seen many interesting contributions. The challenge with causal inference is not that is a new discipline, quite the opposite, but that the current methods represent a very small and simplistic version of causal reasoning. Most models that try to connect causes such as linear regression rely on empirical analysis that makes some assumption about the data. Pure causal inference relies on counterfactual analysis which is a closer representation to how humans make decisions. Imagine a scenario in which you are traveling with your families for vacations to an unknown destination. Before and after the vacation you are wrestling with a few counterfactual questions: Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Answering these questions is the focus of causal inference. Unlike supervised learning, causal inference depends on estimation of unobserved quantities. This if often known as the &quot;fundamental problem&quot; of causal inference which implies that a model never has a purely objective evaluation through a held-out test set. In our vacation example, you can either observe the effects on going on vacation or not going on vacations but never both. This challenge forces causal inference to make critical assumptions about the data generation process. Traditional machine learning frameworks for causal inference try to take shortcuts around the &quot;fundamental problem&quot; resulting on a very frustrating experience for data scientists and developers. Introducing DoWhy Microsoft's DoWhy is a Python-based library for causal inference and analysis that attempts to streamline the adoption of causal reasoning in machine learning applications. Inspired by Judea Pearl's do-calculus for causal inference, DoWhy combines several causal inference methods under a simple programming model that removes many of the complexities of traditional approaches. Compared to its predecessors, DoWhy makes three key contributions to the implementation of causal inference models. Provides a principled way of modeling a given problem as a causal graph so that all assumptions explicit. Provides a unified interface for many popular causal inference methods, combining the two major frameworks of graphical models and potential outcomes. Automatically tests for the validity of assumptions if possible and assesses robustness of the estimate to violations. Conceptually, DoWhy was created following two guiding principles: asking causal assumptions explicit and testing robustness of the estimates to violations of those assumptions. In other words, DoWhy separates the identification of a causal effect from the estimation of its relevance which enables the inference of very sophisticated causal relationships. To accomplish its goal, DoWhy models any causal inference problem in a workflow with four fundamental steps: model, identify, estimate and refute. Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Model: DoWhy models each problem using a graph of causal relationships. The current version of DoWhy supports two formats for graph input: gml (preferred) and dot . The graph might include prior knowledge of the causal relationships in the variables but DoWhy does not make any immediate assumptions. Identify: Using the input graph, DoWhy finds all possible ways of identifying a desired causal effect based on the graphical model. It uses graph-based criteria and do-calculus to find potential ways find expressions that can identify the causal effect Estimate: DoWhy estimates the causal effect using statistical methods such as matching or instrumental variables. The current version of DoWhy supports estimation methods based such as propensity-based-stratification or propensity-score-matching that focus on estimating the treatment assignment as well as regression techniques that focus on estimating the response surface. Verify: Finally, DoWhy uses different robustness methods to verify the validity of the causal effect. Using DoWhy Developers can start using DoWhy by installing the Python module using the following command: python setup.py install Like any other machine learning program, the first step of a DoWhy application is to load the dataset. In this example, imagine that we are trying to infer the correlation between different medical treatments and outcomes represented by the following dataset. Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez DoWhy relies on pandas dataframes to capture the input data: rvar = 1 if np.random.uniform() &amp;gt,0.5 else 0 data_dict = dowhy.datasets.xy_dataset(10000, effect=rvar, sd_error=0.2) df = data_dict['df'] print(df[[&quot;Treatment&quot;, &quot;Outcome&quot;, &quot;w0&quot;]].head()) At this point, we simply need about four steps to infer causal relationships between the variables. The four steps correspond to the four operations of DoWhy: model, estimate, infer and refute. We can start by modeling the problem as a causal graph: model= CausalModel( data=df, treatment=data_dict[&quot;treatment_name&quot;], outcome=data_dict[&quot;outcome_name&quot;], common_causes=data_dict[&quot;common_causes_names&quot;], instruments=data_dict[&quot;instrument_names&quot;]) model.view_model(layout=&quot;dot&quot;) from IPython.display import Image, display display(Image(filename=&quot;causal_model.png&quot;)) Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez The next step is to identify the causal relationships in the graph: identified_estimand = model.identify_effect() Now we can estimate the causal effect and determine if the estimation is correct. This example uses linear regression for simplicity: estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=&quot;backdoor.linear_regression&quot;) # Plot Slope of line between treamtent and outcome =causal effect dowhy.plotter.plot_causal_effect(estimate, df[data_dict[&quot;treatment_name&quot;]], df[data_dict[&quot;outcome_name&quot;]]) Illustration: Jesus Rodriguez Finally, we can use different technique to refute the causal estimator: res_random=model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate, method_name=&quot;random_common_cause&quot;) DoWhy is a very simple and useful framework to implement causal inference models. The current version can be used as a standalone library or integrated into popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The combination of multiple causal inference methods under a single framework and the four-step simple programming model makes DoWhy incredibly simple to use for data scientist tackling causal inference problems.

        <h4>PRM / The World's First Automatic Swab Robot</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra Syddansk UniversitetThe World Health Organization, WHO, recommends rapid and consistent testing for COVID-19 to monitor the circulation of the virus in the general public. In response to this, the world's first automatic swab robot was launched in Denmark on Wednesday May 27th, 2020.The groundbreaking robot has been designed and developed by a team of robotics researchers at the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) in Odense, a city home to one of the world's leading robotics clusters. A new company called Lifeline Robotics, which is owned jointly between the university, Norrsken Foundation, and REInvest Robotics, aims to take the swab robot from prototype to market in record time, hoping to equip the first hospitals in just a matter of months.- Like so many others I was horrified to see the rapid development of the COVID-19 crisis, and I felt I had to do something, explains Esben Østergaard from REInvest Robotics, and co-founder of Universal Robots.- With my background, the obvious choice was to automate the testing process. The current manual process is difficult and cumbersome. A machine will reduce the risk of infection among healthcare staff and patients, as well as give higher quality test results. This is the reason for starting Lifeline Robotics, he says.Just like Esben Østergaard, professor Thiusius Rajeeth Savarimuthu from SDU immediately saw the potential for a swab robot, when the pandemic began to soar across Europe in early March. He gathered a team of 10 researchers, who worked day and night to create a solution with the support from the consortium of investors. - The robot picks up the swab after the patient has scanned her ID-card, and it then identifies the right points in the patient's throat through artificial intelligence-based computer vision. The swab test is conducted gently and securely in a fully automated process, he says. The swab robot has already received two million DKK in funding from Vaekstfonden, which is the Danish state's investment fund. Its future development is also supported by Odense University Hospital:- The robot holds great potential in mass screening for COVID-19 and other virus infections, both in health care and at border controls or airports, says Kim Brixen, medical director at Odense University Hospital.- Staffs are in great demand in other functions, especially during the current epidemic. The robot can work around the clock, and it provides a safe procedure for every citizen tested. The closing of our societies has halted the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries. Large scale testing is part of the strategy during the re-opening of our communities. This invention is a great example of the potential of robotics within the health care sector, he says.Ane Halsboe-Jørgensen, Danish Minister for Higher Education and Science, praises the research and agility demonstrated in the development of the robot:- It is amazing to see how quickly this idea has jumped from idea to action in an area where new inventions are needed here and now. This is a good example of how Danish research manages to move quickly and create concrete and workable solutions amid the global corona crisis, she says.The agile innovation process was made possible due to the unique and well-organized cluster of automation and robotics companies in Odense, where close collaboration between education, research, and the industry is a norm. - In Denmark we are fortunate to have world-class knowledge on robotics, safety, and medical technology. We also have a long-standing design tradition of taking the users seriously in the products we make. Leveraging on my experience from Universal Robots and the network of partners, we will develop and bring this product to market in record time, says Esben Østergaard. - Medical professionals should not work like robots all day long, their time is better spent on patients with special needs. That is why we developed the world's first automatic swabbing robot, specifically for COVID-19, he concludes.

        <h4>Chinese AI Giant Blacklisted by Trump Thrives in Virus Era</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- The future of China's largest artificial intelligence company was thrown into question last year when it was blacklisted by the Trump administration.Today, SenseTime is thriving with growing demand for its facial recognition software, especially as local governments in China adopt its technology to battle the coronavirus. The Hong Kong-based startup's revenue surged 147% to 5 billion yuan ($720 million) in 2019 and its customer base increased by about 500 to 1,200 clients, according to co-founder Xu Bing. Sales are on track to climb 80% this year to about 9 billion yuan and gross profit could double, according to people familiar with the matter. &quot;We see business demand for ways to mitigate the virus outbreak on the rise,&quot; Xu said in a phone interview. He and SenseTime declined to comment on revenue projections in an emailed statement. That momentum has SenseTime contemplating an initial public offering. The company is close to completing a $1.5 billion funding round that values it at about $8.5 billion pre-money, paving the way for a stock sale, people familiar have said. The company -- whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp., Temasek Holdings Pte and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- is leaning toward a dual listing in Hong Kong and China, the people added. The Covid-19 pandemic has been extremely controversial ever since infections emerged in Wuhan eight months ago. Countries such as the U.S. blame Chinese authorities for censoring information about the outbreak that could have helped slow the spread. Now China's economy is recovering quickly from the crisis, while the U.S. and many others struggle to get back on track. Chinese authorities have succeeded by using laws and technologies that governments like the U.S. have resisted. When a cluster of Covid-19 patients flared up in northeastern China, the government installed sensors to guard the city's subway entrances. The cameras provided by SenseTime detect whether the passengers are wearing masks, their temperature, and even their identities with their faces covered. It's an example of how the ruling Communist Party, once wary of private entrepreneurs, is now supporting technology companies that have come under attack from the Trump administration, including SenseTime, Huawei Technologies Co., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd., parent of TikTok. The country has pledged to spend $1.4 trillion to develop its own tech industry and overtake the U.S. in key sectors. Read more: AI Unicorn SenseTime Is Said to Mull Hong Kong, China IPO In the case of facial recognition, concerns about privacy are taking a back seat while the country militantly traces and tracks outbreaks. Hard-line measures adopted by Beijing allow provincial governments, companies and residential complexes to deploy facial recognition devices with little . The temptation to use such technology more broadly against the virus has fueled privacy concerns. In April, more than 130 human rights groups published a letter cautioning against an expansion of surveillance powers. &quot;States cannot simply disregard rights such as privacy and freedom of expression in the name of tackling a public health crisis,&quot; it said in the letter. Still, business is booming for SenseTime. The company is working with 127 cities across China to use cameras to analyze everything from traffic to residential complex security. Its facial recognition program for subways, known as the Smart Commute System, is used in cities from central Zhengzhou and Xi'an to northeastern Harbin. Passengers can opt to register with the cities' subway apps to pay their transportation fee using face scans. That can allow them to be identified even with their masks on. The company declined to disclose how many people have selected the program, because the data sits with the respective city governments. The technology is possible in part because SenseTime zooms in on data points on a person's face not covered by a mask to enable identification, said Xu. And it's not the only one working on such technology. Wuhan University, for example, said it's developed competing software with 90% accuracy, according to a local media report. &quot;It's data gravity that nobody can stop. China is pushing facial recognition across the nation during this pandemic,&quot; said Isaac Mao, an angel tech investor. &quot;In the U.S., there are roadblocks including civil society, privacy regulations and governance structure to push back on facial recognition and companies profiting from it are facing a backlash, but in China this is what's missing.&quot; (Updates with SenseTime's backers in the fourth paragraph) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Eight Ways Wine Will Change in 2021</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Where to start? Covid-19 upended all our oenophile habits, shifting how we buy wine (online more than ever), how we taste and learn about it (virtually), and where we end up drinking it. (Not at parties, bars, and restaurants.)Thankfully, many cities considered wine shops to be essential businesses.Surprisingly, the pandemic didn't shift what we put in our glasses all that much. Rosé is still hot. So is hard seltzer, which, along with canned cocktails (both, ugh!), grew 43% during 2020.The earliest harvest ever in Burgundy and devastating fires in California wine country for the fourth year in a row reminded people that climate change is a truly serious issue, and inspired new wine initiatives to save the planet.Expect many of 2020's trends to evolve in 2021-helped along by new digital and AI technology innovations, even if everyone really dreams of returning to sharing wine with others outside their homes.Here's what else I see in my crystal glass:Pink prosecco is the new new thingRosé. Just. Doesn't. Stop. Retailer Wineaccess.com sold seven (!) times more bottles of rosé wine in 2020 than in summer 2019.I'm betting 2021's big pink drink will be prosecco rosé. At the end of November, the approved category launched in Italy, which already has a boom in big-value pink wines. John Gillespie, founder and chief executive officer of market research firm Wine Opinions, says that combining the prosecco trend with the rosé trend is as close to a sure thing for success in the U.S. as he's seen.More than 100 labels have sought U.S. approval. A couple are already on shelves, and more are coming in 2021. I'll be reporting on which are worth drinking.Online wine access will get way betterOnline sales are booming with growth in the three digits. Rob McMillan, founder of Silicon Valley Bank Wine Division, reports that for small producers, it's 153%. Expect new and expanded shopping sites and search engines in 2021.I have my eye on Pix.wine, from wine tech platform Emetry.

          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra RSU Rating Service GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;The model was developed using the Supervised Machine Learning approach&quot;, says Carsten Demski, head of team in RSU's methodology department and in charge of the project. &quot;Based on a dataset comprising more than 3 million news reports on some 3,000 companies we've been able to develop a stable and accurate credit risk model. Note that 80% of these companies are unlisted.&quot;The new system component automatically analyses very large amounts of news information every day and flags critical messages. Analysts can then read these messages directly in Risk Guard.&quot;Risk Guard enables our customers to monitor borrowers continuously and react to signs of financial weakness. Our system is optimised for detecting such risks up to one year in advance&quot;, explains Dana Wengrzik, Managing Director of RSU Rating Service Unit GmbH &amp; Co. KG. &quot;We developed Risk Guard after many banks had been caught off-guard by the 2008 financial crisis.&quot;RSU has been operating Risk Guard since 2011. The system currently monitors risk parameters of some 3,100 exchange-listed companies and banks with which RSU's customers do business.&quot;Although our clients are very satisfied with Risk Guard, it didn't cover unlisted companies in the past&quot; says Demski. &quot;Also, we wanted to find a way of analysing news reports automatically because they simply are an important source of information in credit risk management.&quot;Risk Guard now picks up signs of elevated credit risk for both listed and unlisted companies, which saves analysts a great deal of time and work.With a long economic upturn apparently drawing to a close, banks and institutional investors are well advised to attach increasing importance to risk detection. &quot;Many banks are testing intelligent solutions for processing business news&quot;, says Dana Wengrzik. &quot;But it takes top-level expertise to develop and implement a fully operational system. Which is why we are proud to be one step ahead of even the big players in the market.&quot;Kontakt:RSU Rating Service Unit GmbH &amp; Co. KG

        <h4>This Is What Biden Has Said on Major U.S. Flashpoints With China</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- While Joe Biden has spent much of the campaign criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump's policies toward China, his own platform sounds more like a change of tactics than a strategy overhaul. The former vice president -- a long-time member of a foreign policy establishment that advocated engagement with Beijing -- has shifted along with the rest of Washington toward a more confrontational tone during Trump's term, denouncing Xi Jinping as a &quot;thug.&quot; Still, the Democratic nominee has faced few questions about how he would handle China more effectively than his Republican opponent. What Biden has said so far points to a more multilateral approach that places greater emphasis on alliances and human rights and is less reliant on tariffs and arms sales. Here's where he stands on some of the biggest flash points between the world's two largest economies: Joe Biden speaks during an event in Warm Springs, Georgia on Tuesday. Photographer: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trade, Tariffs Biden has mocked Trump's January trade deal with Xi as &quot;hollow&quot; and blamed the president's tariffs for accelerating the decline in American manufacturing. But he hasn't committed to either scrapping the pact or withdrawing the tariffs -- two key sources of leverage over China for the next administration. &quot;I will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy -- a plan -- to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness.&quot; -- Biden, in statement to United Steelworkers in May Biden has pitched a $400 billion &quot;Buy American&quot; plan to direct government purchases toward domestically made goods. He has also pledged to &quot;unite the economic might of democracies around the world to counter abusive economic practices&quot; -- something China's critics in places like Brussels and Tokyo complained wasn't possible under Trump's &quot;America First&quot; policies. A major question is whether Biden will seek to rejoin the Pacific trade pact many China hawks viewed as the best way to counter Beijing's economic might before Trump withdrew from it as one of his first official actions. Biden supported the deal -- now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership -- as part of former President Barack Obama's administration, but said during a Democratic primary debate last year that he would insist on renegotiating &quot;pieces&quot; of the pact. TikTok, Huawei Biden has similarly promised a more global approach to countering the influence of Chinese technology companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. and TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. He acknowledged &quot;genuine concern&quot; about how TikTok handles data from its some 100 million American users, while faulting Trump for trying to make money off a deal to secure U.S. control over the social media network's local business. &quot;God only knows what they're doing with information they're picking up off of here. So as president, I will go into it very deeply I'll get the cyber-experts in with me to give me what is the best solution to deal with it.&quot; -- Biden, during campaign stop in Duluth, Minnesota, in September Biden said in February that he supported a ban on using Huawei equipment in the U.S., although he's said little about whether he would continue the Trump administration's &quot;Clean Network&quot; program to convince allies to swear off Huawei products in critical communications networks. He has said he would work with &quot;fellow democracies&quot; to develop global rules on cybertheft, data privacy and artificial intelligence. The former vice president pledged greater focus on issues such as intellectual property theft that took a back seat to agricultural purchases in Trump's &quot;phase one&quot; trade deal. He has promised new sanctions against Chinese firms that steal U.S. technology and threatened to cut them off from accessing the U.S. market and financial system. Rights, Sanctions Although the Trump administration has brought increased attention to China's human rights practices, those efforts have often been undercut by reports of the president's praise for Xi's hard-line approach. Biden has vowed a more consistent message from the White House. &quot;I will put values back at the center of our foreign policy, including how we approach the U.S.-China relationship.&quot; -- Biden, in a campaign statement in August He has vowed to &quot;fully enforce&quot; the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act signed by Trump last year and meet with exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, if elected. Biden has labeled China's mass detention and re-education program for the Xinjiang region's predominately Muslim Uighur minority as &quot;genocide&quot; and called for an international effort to make a united stand against the campaign. The Democratic nominee said he would convene a &quot;Summit for Democracy&quot; to reach new commitments to fight corruption and authoritarianism and advance human rights. That would include pressing technology companies to make pledges to &quot;ensure their algorithms and platforms are not empowering the surveillance state, facilitating repression in China and elsewhere.&quot; Defense, Taiwan As vice president, Biden was an advocate for Obama's &quot;pivot&quot; to Asia. However, he's unlikely to replace Trump's &quot;Indo-Pacific Strategy,&quot; which focuses on drawing India into a broader coalition of democracies to help offset China's regional weight. Rather, Biden might seek to play down the military component of U.S. engagement in Asia, which under Trump has prioritized arms sales. The party platform approved during Democratic National Convention called for countering China &quot;without resorting to self-defeating, unilateral tariff wars or falling into the trap of a new Cold War.&quot; &quot;Democrats are committed to the Taiwan Relations Act and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,&quot; Democratic Party, in platform released in August It's unclear how Biden would approach Taiwan, whose president, Tsai Ing-wen, has received unprecedented support from Washington as Trump ramped up his attacks on China. While Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has more in common with Biden's left-leaning coalition on trade, environmental and social issues, the presidential contender has for decades advocated the &quot;strategic ambiguity&quot; sought to minimize the risk of a direct conflict with China over Taiwan. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Six ways that technology is changing our homes</h4>
        <div>
          The future is here and it's happening in your home. Adrian Weckler explores how the latest devices will make our domestic life run more smoothly1 Most homes are becoming 'smart homes' without us even knowing itYou might think that smart homes are entities owned by people in California or Sweden. But a smart home is simply an ordinary home with some bits that let you control them from a phone or which enable various systems to 'talk' to one another. Like your lights. Or your alarm. Or your heating system. The most common examples are products such as the Nest smart thermostat (?269), which connects to your heating system and then runs it according to how cold it is or by what time it is. Alternatively, it runs things based on whether you're in the house or not. Products like Nest are programmable from your phone and can do a huge number of things, based on other conditions occurring around them. It analyses the times that you use your heating and starts to suggest times when you might not need your heating on. It does this using sensors and software. The company claims that most of its thermostat users end up with lower heating bills.2 Almost all household appliance lines are starting to come with some form of online connectivity or artificial intelligenceYou may not yet own an internet fridge, a robotic vacuum cleaner or a web-connected washing machine. But judging by the production plans of the major manufacturers, you probably soon will.Take hoovers. A growing number of the major brands now have one model in their line-up that is designed to go around your house by itself, cleaning. Dyson's 360 Eye model may be the best in class, but Samsung, Roomba and others are close behind.Using a combination of sensors, cameras and artificial intelligence, these cleaning machines are increasingly independent of manual management: you just set them down and away they go, navigating various obstacles in your rooms. And they can be monitored via your phone through your home's WiFi.Fridges are slowly getting the connected treatment, too. Samsung's newest model uses a combination of cameras and sensors to tell you when certain foods appear to be going off. They can also be checked via your phone from a supermarket, to let you see whether you're running low on milk or eggs.Cookers are developing in slightly different ways. New models from Miele, for example, come with advanced sensors that measure the size or proportion of food you're preparing and then cook them for the adjusted amount of time. The idea is that you never under-cook or overcook a roast chicken again. (For those who worry about the lost art of cooking, manufacturers are betting that for every culinary masterpiece you lovingly prepare for dinner party comrades, there are five or six more prosaic dishes that you just have to knock out on week days for your family.)And even if you don't want to invest in a new home appliance, some manufacturers are now making add-on gadgets that turn old appliances into new connected ones. For example, LG's SmarthinQ sensor can measure things like vibration on the outside of a washing machine or movement on a safe door. The idea would be to let you know when a washing cycle is finished or when someone has opened a safe.3 Voice controls are probably the waY of the futureWe've all seen the way that Star Trek officers control machines - from on and off orders to complex questions - by speaking commands out loud. That process is well under way in the real world. The early adopters are devices such as Amazon's Echo and Google's Home, which take voice orders from you to control WiFi-connected systems around the house (including your lights, music streaming and heating). They also act as voice-controlled interfaces for common queries and internet searches, talking back to you. Apple and Microsoft aren't far behind, plotting to integrate home devices with Siri and Cortana, respectively. These systems aren't for the paranoid, however: because they are 'always listening' in your home, there are more than a few fears about surveillance vulnerabilities.4 Not everything needs to be connected to your phoneSome smart gadgets don't need humans to tell them what to do anymore. They're starting to talk to each other. Specifically, some of them are using an emerging standard called IFTTT ('IF This, Then That'). This is a system where one connected devices does something - switches on a light, for example - while another one detects something else happening. For example, if a sensor on a door detects movement, another sensor attached to a lamp or the radio or the heating might turn one of those things on. There are umpteen household products and gadgets adopting this standard, such as Philips Hue lighting, Nest's Thermostat, Amazon Echo, WeMo smart plugs and more.5 Lots of this stuff is very affordableThere's a lot you can get for less than ?100. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to make almost any device in your house 'connected' is to attach it to an inexpensive 'smart' plug. Belkin's WeMo plug is probably the best example here. Costing around ?40, it basically connects whatever is plugged into it to your phone (via a free phone app). At a minimum, it allows you to switch it (and therefore whatever is connected to it) on and off from your phone, wherever you are. But you can also program it. For example, you can ask it to keep track of when the sun goes down (by checking online) and to switch itself on when this happens. So being 'connected' is now a common, affordable reality: you already own most of the tools needed to make it happen.6 Even luddites will be tempted by new wave home security systemsEnquired about a home security alarm recently? Most of them now come with pretty advanced remote monitoring capabilities. Off-the-shelf options are popular too. There are umpteen webcams on the market that give a live feed to your phone from wherever you place one in your home. These not only let you have a look at what's going on in real time, but they also now have motion detectors that send your phone alerts if any movement is detected. Some such webcams even store clips for you online so that it can't be gotten around simply by being smashed. Webcams are also very handy for keeping tabs on sleeping infants. Then there are things like smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Some of today's 'smart' models have beefed up sensors that can tell the difference between too much steam and smoke and eliminate other 'false positives'.Sunday Independent

        <h4>Blogindlæg: Udpluk fra en god bog om at genopfinde samfundet</h4>
        <div>
          Men det gør nu ikke noget. Grunden er nemlig at vi skal lave et spændende projekt om entreprenørskab. Mere kan jeg egentlig ikke sige, da jeg har lovet ikke at tale om det.Men projektet har betydet at vi må købe nye bøger ind til Tårnet. Og som nogle af jer måske ved, så er jeg meget glad for nye bøger.Og selv føler jeg, at når man har at gøre med projekter som KRÆVER at man skal købe nye, spændende bøger, for at løse opgaven, så har man fat i det rigtige projekt at bruge sin tid på.En tid der også kræver lidt i sin 4 dage lange sommerferie. Hvor der så nu læses i sofaen i familiesommerhuset på Bornholm.Blandt andet i den nye bog af Charles Handy. Handy er for mange en af de mest betydningsfulde management writere, på linje med Peter Drucker, Warren Bennis, CK Prahalad og Clayton Christensen. Det er Handy der er forfatter til bøgerne -The Empty Raincoat-, -Understanding Organizations- og -Gods of Management-. Han er tidligere leder i Shell, økonom og i dag professor ved London Business School.Ja, jeg burde egentlig ikke skrive den her blog. Jeg burde arbejde på OPGAVEN. Men nogle gange har man jo brug for en pause. Og den vil jeg bruge på at lave en lynanmeldelse af Handys nye bog, -The Second Curve   Thoughts on Reinventing Society-.Det er en god bog.I stedet for at trætte med selvfede anmelder-tanker, vil jeg blot skrive udpluk fra bogen. Så kan du selv bedømme om du er enig med Charles Handy og måske endda købe bogen for at læse mere om tankerne bag:- - -I realised that much of my life [] was governed by the [] principle of -If it works don-t fix it.- Exhortations that it won-t work like that much longer, or could work better, fall on deaf ears. The status quo, people kept telling me, has to be better than the unknown. If there has to be change it should be -better than yesterday-, not different. But society is not working as it should. Living is getting harder, not easier, for most.[] As Tancredi famously told his uncle the Prince in Lampedusa-s novel -The Leopard-, -For things to to remain the same, things will have to change.-Already, as I see it, too much of all that is new favours the few and not the many. Society is out of balance.Looking back now, after eighty decades of life, I wonder how it was that, for the first three decades at least, I seldom questioned the way things worked, or were supposed to work, in Britain and in much of the rest of the world. I assumed that because things had always been that way that was the way they were meant to be, that those in authority knew what they were doing and were well advised. I know better now.The pace of change in a democracy is glacial, to be measured in generations not years. Government may often know what they should do, but not how to get re-elected after doing it.My hope is that the book will kindle [the next generation's] curiosity, provoke and stir their imagination, and encourage discussion among friends and colleagues. It was John Maynard Keynes who said, -I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.-Second Curve thinking does not come easily. It requires imagination, intuition and instinct more than rational analysis.Might it be wiser to aim to grow better without growing bigger?Has money become too powerful? If Facebook can rustle up 19 billion dollars from its own resources to buy up a possible competitor, if Google can use its wealth to corner all the artificial intelligence expertise around, are we seeing the need for a modern trust-busting Teddy Roosevelt?One of our faults is that we are too modest, too willing to believe that those in power know best.Researchers in Oxford University suggest that 47 per cent of today-s jobs will be replaced by computers within the next two decades.Walter Mischel, a leading expert on self-control, devised the Marshmellow Test almost 50 years ago. In an empty room he presented young children with a choice: take one marshmellow now or wait a while and have two. It was a test of deferred gratification. After observing the later lives of the children he was convinced that deferred gratification was crucial to a successful life, to better social functioning and to greater sense of self-worth. If he is right then the world of instant constant communication is endangering the successful futures of our young.Markets are useful, but not for everything. Nor do they always work as they should.It would be [] better if [one] compared outcomes not just inputs, since it is the relation between the two that really matters. That was the flaw in [the Soviet] system. You can have a very cheap process producing a very bad product, as happened all too often in the Soviet regimes and still does in our own public sector. A proper market with measured outcomes as well as costs would signal that.A hospital might best be judged on the health of its surrounding population, or at least the continuing life of its patients. A school ideally needs to look at the progress of its students 20 years on. Since such measures of success are both difficult and impractical these organisations use substitute measures   the reoffending rate, the recovery time, the examination results, even though there is often no direct connection with the true longer-term purpose.Intermediate measures fall foul of the MacNamara fallacy, as expressed by the US Secretary of Defence Robert MacNamara during the Vietnam War. It goes like this: The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can-t be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can-t be measured easily really isn-t important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can-t be easily measured really doesn-t exist. This is suicide.Robert Kennedy once said, GDP -measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country: it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile-.Better not bigger. I should have realised, because most of the organisations that I have found it most interesting to work with down the years have been ones where it made no sense to grow any bigger.In America the government once split up AT&amp;T. Why not the new giants?The individual pursuit of more money is a particular snare, because there is no obvious end to it. There will always be someone with more to act as a comparison and a challenge. It is one of the paradoxes of growth that it can end up as a recipe for perpetual dissatisfaction.Companies are not, as some assume, the vassals of their shareholders. A company is a legal person, in every country. The shareholders do not own the business, just the shares. There is a difference. The formal rights of those shareholders only extend to the appointment of a board, and to the remaining assets of the business on its break-up after all other claimants have been paid. The responsibilities of the directors are to the company as a whole, not to the shareholders alone. It was a widespread misinterpretation of company law that gave rise to the elevation of shareholder value as the prime purpose of the company, to short-term thinking and the splurge of bonuses tied to share performance.It has taken 40 years for people to begin to see that Milton Friedman-s idea was not working. Society has not benefited, indeed it almost collapsed in 2008.The distinguished academic Roger Martin has calculated that, overall, company profit were lower in the 40 years after 1970 than they were in the 40 years before, when managers were paid normal salaries to do their job. If we seem to be living better lives it is mainly because there are now two earners in each family where one used to suffice, and those two are working harder and longer than ever before.We have moved from value creation to value extraction.It would be interesting to consider the implications that would follow if we thought of a business as a community rather than a property.To get [businesses as well as other organisations] thinking, all they need to do is to look at some recent findings on the levels of engagement by the workforce in large organisations. The evidence is disturbing: 80 per cent of them say they are not really engaged with the work of the organisation.Michael Maccoby, a psychoanalyst and renowned leadership authority, has described how the modern dual-career or single-parent families, with children in day care from their early years, have created young adults with more interactive social character and peer group than their parents, while their confident access to every kind of information makes them more ready to challenge authority, to be free agents in charge of their own lives.[There is a] difference between efficiency and effectiveness. They should be the same but, in practice, they work differently. Efficiency starts from the input end while effectiveness works back from the end results. As Peter Drucker also said, -There is nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency something that should not be done at all.- Or the opposite, I would add, not doing what should be done because it would cost more, and therefore would appear to be less efficient. Required to increase efficiency, the prison service in Britain was asked to cut costs. They therefore sliced off what they saw as non-essential activities in order to keep security at the necessary level. The problem, as the journalist and blogger Simon Caulkin pointed out, was that these non-essentials included such things as education and gardening which had proved to be the most effective ways of preventing reoffending after leaving prison. In other words, the efficiency savings resulted in more returning prisoners, thus increasing the cost in the long run. Had they started at the other end, with the evidence of the relative longer-term effectiveness of different aspects of the prison regime, they might have decided differently.Leadership [] means knowing your followers.[In Europe by 2050] there are only two workers for every pensioner and those pensioners live until they are nearly 90.Recent surveys reveal that the average Briton would like to retire at 63, go to live in a bungalow near the sea, 11 miles from their nearest offspring, and live for a further 25 years. They estimate that they would need a pension of £23,457 per annum []. The evidence to date suggests that this is optimistic. To achieve such a pension they would have to squirrel away £10,425 a year for 45 years. On average the survey showed the only contributed £2,671 last year, enough for just five years at their wished-for standard of living.Fundamentally, most countries need a complete rethink of their approach to lifetime financial planning now that life goes on so much longer.The problem with the self-responsible society, the one we are slowly becoming, is that we have to learn how to educate ourselves in areas that we did not need to worry about before, because someone else was taking care of them. Financial literacy, understanding how the money world works, is one of those areas and it does not come easy.This is perhaps the most urgent problem facing us today, to restore a proper justice to the creation and distribution of wealth. Wealth has to be spread around more widely without destroying the motivation to create it in the first place.We could always call their bluff, the bluff of those who assert that high rewards are needed to retain their talent. Many would be happy to work for less if that became the norm. If they didn-t, there must be others equally talented who would. The pool of potential senior executives is neither as small nor as exclusive as those inside it consider it to be.Pre-distribution, the economist call it   making the system fairer to begin with, rather than compensating for its deficiencies after the fact   an ugly word for an important point.Something is wrong if you can make more money while you are asleep [waiting for house prices to go up] than if you go out to work.Perhaps a special fund should be created, possibly paid for by the tax on the sale of one-s home, which could be used to allow all work-based education to be tax-deductible and to pay a subsistence wage to learners.Schools, colleges, banks and venture capitalists, businesses and government agencies need to combine to pump-start a new enterprise-led revolution.[I have an] optimistic belief in humanity that there exists in each of us the seed of possibility. This is our -golden seed- which, if we only knew what it was, and if it were to be fertilised, watered and cared for, might lead to personal fulfilment. The best gift that you can give anyone, I maintain, is to help them to find and grow their golden seed.In 1983 Howard Gardner of Harvard University revolutionised much of our thinking on intelligence with his theory of multiple intelligences. [] Gardner [] identified seven types of intelligence:Linguistic intelligenceLogical-mathematical intelligenceMusical intelligenceSpatial intelligenceBodily-kinaesthetic intelligenceIntrapersonal intelligenceInterpersonal intelligence[] The problem is that formal education systems focus on the first two, linguistic and logical-mathematical, and largely ignore others.Ideally we shouldaim for an individual curriculum, one tailored to the needs of each child, rather than a national curriculum that seeks to make every child the same.In our study of the Alchemists [entrepreneurs] it was noteworthy that most of them were second or third children, often less strictly disciplined, with less expected of them initially, more free therefore to be different.The truth is that the nurturing of the golden seed is best done by a mentor.One study that my wife and I did was entitled -Reinvented Lives: Women at Sixty-. In this book we interviewed 28 women who, in their sixties, reinvented themselves to live a new life, often realising an ambition that had been delayed while they brought up a family, but often discovering talents in themselves that they had not realised that they had. It is never too late. One of them became ordained as a priest, another fulfilled a long ambition to work at the South Pole after a life of writing children-s books and raising her family. A third wanted to help out her daughter and found herself running a café in a seaside town and being rather good at it. It is never too late to dig up your seed and start a new curve in life.True learning, I was later to understand, starts with curiosity, with a problem or a challenge, a question that you need to answer.[] Turning students into teachers of others is the best way for them to learn.When young people are maturing earlier it seems odd that we are steadily postponing the entry into serious work, asking for ever more evidence of scholastic achievement before paying anyone a wage. Better surely to pay them to learn while they work at every level, fitting in the university or college learning when it is appropriate.Large organisations are slowly realising that political ideas and theories often have more to tell them than management manuals. Federalism is a new curve whose time has come.Settling for an intermediate goal such as money is much easier than answering the really big question, -What is life for?- What is it all about?Survival not progress is what most settle for in the end.I keep a white stone on my desk. It is there because of a verse in the book of Revelation in the Bible which says, -To the one who overcomes, the angel said, I will give a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.-As a classroom exercise I have on occasion aske mature students to do the obituary exercise. -Imagine,- I tell them, -that you die in your mid-eighties. Your funeral is well attended and your best friend has agreed in advance to give the eulogy, but you asked him to keep it short. Write what you would like him to say in less than 300 word.-Frederick Wiseman is 84, he showed his latest documentary in Cannes in 2014. Asked why he goes on making films he said, -All my friends are either dead or still working.- There is always work to be done, a Second Curve waiting to be invented.

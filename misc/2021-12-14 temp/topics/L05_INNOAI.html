        <h4>My End-to-End Process for Data Science Projects</h4>
        <div>
          Why do I write this story? Simply because not every data science project is successful. For sure, you can Google this topic and you will find thousands of reasons. For me, projects that didn't succeed have been the biggest opportunities to improve my process and my skills. In this story, I will briefly summarize my learnings by providing my current (and still improving) process in a data science project. I do not doubt that this process does not apply to everyone simply because there is not a single definition of a &quot;data science project&quot;. My aim here is to share my experience by summarizing the different steps of a project. It does not guarantee success, but, at least, this process will try to address all pitfalls that you, as a Data Scientist, can prevent. My role is to create pipelines that consume data and provide insight(s) (see my definition of pipeline in my previous story ). This is the process I am using to do so. Scope the solution The first step is to scope the solution. Sometimes it is very hard to find the balance between expectations and pricing. My recommendation is to drive any decisions by looking at the real need. This would allow putting aside &quot;nice to have&quot; s and prioritize &quot;mandatory features&quot;. Start with &quot;why?&quot; (ref: Simon Sinek) To draft the scope of the project, the first step is to work with the client and to understand the pain point and his motivations. In this story, I will use the term client for the person paying for the project. In reality, the client might be a director/VP/CTO of your company. The client is the one that decided to invest in this project. It is mandatory to understand why this person is interested in this project. Maximizing production? Scaling of a process? Avoid failures in his factory? Anything What is the pain point? This is very important for the next step. A good trick is to ask how the client is currently treating his pain point. If there is already a metric capturing the efficiency of the current process. Who will use it? Many times I had the opportunity to draft a scope without even knowing who will use the solution. This is wrong! A project is successful if the solution is used. I have been in projects where the user is not even clearly identified. This is the best way to create something that will never be used. A CEO of a company says: &quot;AI is trendy and cool, we should do something with it&quot;. RUN! Let's take an example. A director/VP wants to use AI to optimize stock management in his factory. Great! Then I started talking about the solution but the future user is not even in the room. We start working on the project and we decided that the algorithm will provide an email every morning with a forecast of demand to help the stock manager to make the best decision. I work hard and I succeed in this task. We even develop the infrastructure to support the algorithm. Everything is done and the CEO is happy! Well, guess what? This forecast is not even the manager's biggest concern. He has a hard time figuring out in real-time where and what items are available in the factory. Too bad, a simple interactive dashboard would have done the job. The forecast is useless without this information. The project is a failure. In another situation, the manager needs a forecast every week and not every day, or the forecast needs to be available in realtime not per day All those situations happen. My best recommendation is to bring the future user as early as you can in the conversation because he is the best person to define the needs What? At this point, what I want is a clear success criterion. Client: &quot;I need the algorithm to predict when my assembly line will fail&quot;. Me: &quot;Ok&quot;, me looking at the operator, &quot;How much in advance do you need this prediction?&quot; (Here, I am trying to define the granularity of the problem.) Operator: &quot;I need the prediction for 2 days in advance, and I need this information in the morning before 7 am&quot;. Me: &quot;Great, but you have to understand that chances are the algorithm will produce false alarms and also miss some failures. Are you comfortable with this? What is the current situation? How much cost failure and how much cost asking the maintenance team to work on a machine if it is not needed? How many machines you can check within a day?&quot; I need all those answers to create a success criterion. Me: &quot;How do you solve this problem right now?&quot;. Operator: &quot;We have 1000 machines and we have at least 1 of them would fail every day. We cannot check them all, so, we prioritize our investigation by checking the one that has not been checked for a long time&quot;. The last information is very important because it tells me where is the bar. If I simulate the current strategy, I can evaluate how much better my solution is. All this information helps me to define a metric with a success criterion. In this type of situation, I rather use a metric like a Hit Rate. The number of true positives within the top N most probable predicted failures. N is the number of interventions the maintenance team can take care of within a day. I rarely communicate metrics like F-Measure or AUC to the client because he cannot use this measurement to decide if the solution is a success or not. At the end of the conversation, we found out that a Hit Rate of 2 would be valuable enough for the solution to be used. Also, thanks to the information I collected, I can price how much money the client is currently wasting and how much money the client can save with a successful solution. Then, I can convert my metric in dollars when I present progress to the client. An important consideration is that my solution will be integrated into an existing system. This system exists for a reason and people are using it. The AI solution will alter this system. This disruption has to be anticipated otherwise the final phase of the project (when people use the solution) may cause unexpected additional costs. This disruption might be so important that the client might finally change his mind and refuse to take the risk of releasing the solution (it happened to me). My recommendation is to introduce this potential disruption in the conversation during the initial scoping of the solution. At the end of the discussion, I ask for a snippet of data, some information about the way we can collect the data, etc I do data analysis (1-2 days) to check if there are no big red flags. Data engineers would also take part in the conversation to draft an architecture. Now, I have the scope, I can move to the next step which is working on the solution. The Proof Of Concept (POC) phase The objective of this phase is to demonstrate that the project is viable and can bring value. To optimize the process in this phase, you have to consider what needs to be constraints. Basically in a POC phase, I cannot constraint the time, the resources, and the accuracy at the same time. Time means the amount of time I can spend on this project. Resources are the number of persons allocated to this project. Accuracy means the accuracy of the model. Theoretically, you can only constraints two of them. In reality, resources are more or less always constrained. Maybe some companies can allocate an &quot;infinite&quot; number of resources on a project. I have never been in such a situation. If you relax accuracy, it corresponds to a &quot;hackathon mode&quot; or &quot;spike&quot;. It is useful when you want to investigate an idea, most probably, for a short time. The most realistic choice is to relax time. Some clients have a hard time working in this mode because they have deadlines to respect and they might have the feeling that the POC will never end. But, the trick is to communicate progress to the client in an efficient way. For that reason, I use the Agile methodology. This paradigm has been invented for software development but I adapt it in the context of a data science project. If you are not familiar with the wording, I invite you to read some articles about Agile. Sprint 1: I work generally in a sprint of 2 or 3 weeks depending on the client. The objective of the first sprint is to establish a baseline. A baseline is declared when the first end-to-end pipeline (from data to metric) delivers a number. In this initial sprint, I choose the simplest path. This is the only thing that matters. Get a number as fast as possible. For instance, if some variables have missing values, the simplest is to remove those variables from the dataset. Or if I have to choose a model, the simplest is a linear regression or a logistic regression because there is no parametrization. No creasy preprocessing, only simple steps. Avoid any type of step that would imply fine-tuning or calibration. No PCA, no standardization, nothing. Basically, in this sprint, I set up the CI/CD, the git repository, I write a parser, and I create the simplest version of the pipeline to end up with a number for the metric. The only thing that I need to pay attention to is the evaluation strategy. It is hard to compare performances between 2 pipelines if you switch between 66% train 33% test procedure to a cross-validation procedure. The evaluation strategy needs to be as close as possible from the way the pipeline will be used. In the above example, I would use a growing window for the training set and a sliding window for the test set. Sprint 2: The second sprint is to productize the baseline. With the help of data engineers and DevOps, we set up the architecture to support the pipeline. Some people prefer to wait until the pipeline reaches the level of accuracy as it is defined in the scope. For me, I try to unblock the other teams as early as I can to produce an MVP as soon as possible. For my sprints, I use standard cycles. A stand up meeting every day to check if there are no blockers. We do planning at the beginning of the sprint and demo at the end. We also do retrospective from time to time. At the end of the sprint, we check if the new version of the pipeline provides better results compared to the baseline. If yes, it corresponds to the new baseline for the next sprint. I track this information over sprints and I include it in the demo. I show the plot above to the client during the demo. He can decide 1) to continue for another sprint, 2) to declare that we reach the objectives or 3) to drop the project because the current solution is too far from the expectations and it would take a prohibitive amount of time to finish. This early stoping is beneficial for everyone. For the client, he is not wasting money on a project that might be too expensive and for the team to be reallocated to another project with a higher probability of success. The demo is also the opportunity to validate new assumptions. During each iteration, I increase the complexity of the pipeline. For instance, I gather external data to augment the dataset, I improve the preprocessing, add more features, use a different algorithm, etc The danger here is to over-engineer the pipeline. For instance, I don't try to draft a new deep learning architecture at the second iteration or I don't add crazy complex features to nail one or two outliers that would not affect the metric drastically. To identify what can be the most impactful alteration of the pipeline, I often look at instances that have the largest error to try to find an explanation and derive a new cleaning strategy and/or new features. I order those alterations by the amount of work and start with the simplest. A note about CI/CD and notebook: A measurement of the metric has to be reproducible. So I disregard any data point that has not been produced by the CI/CD pipeline. If the result has been obtained in a Jupyter notebook, I have to convince myself that it can be reproduced on another machine. Notebooks are cool for data analysis but they require strong discipline to make sure the results are reproducible. I know I am not capable of such a thing. For that reason, I only trust numbers from the CI/CD. I have been in a situation where I claimed to the client that we meet the expectation and finally, I was not able to reproduce the results. It is very frustrating and costly for everyone I wish you never have to live in this situation. Productization I strongly recommend you have a look at the article &quot; Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems &quot;. The machine learning code is a small piece of the entire solution. It is important to have a clear picture of the additional steps needed for productization. productization requires the support of data engineers and DevOps. Hopefully, the POC is done and we met the success criterion. Good!! Now we need to productize the pipeline. There are two main ways to proceed: Hands-off . The results of the POC are translated into specifications. A team of software developers take over, rewrite the entire code, and productize the pipeline. Push to prod . My code is reused &quot;as is&quot; and with the help of data engineers and DevOps, we build an infrastructure around it. Both approaches have pros and cons. The hands-off approach will make sure that the solution is more stable. Because a data scientist is not always an experimented developer (no offense here), productization of the code is often in the hand of other people. It is often the case in a large company. A detail, in this situation, the ownership of the code does not belong to the data scientist anymore. So fixing bugs is done by the software development team. The second approach is to ask the data scientist to wrap his code into a library and it will be used in another system. For instance, in a lambda function in the cloud. This approach is faster since we avoid rewriting code. The code is &quot;cleaned&quot; and the debts are paid. If you follow my recommendations in my previous story , this step can be done efficiently. Finally, the owner of the code remains the data scientist and I am in charge of fixing bugs. This way is often chosen in small companies and startups where a limited number of people can work on each project. I prefer to use the second option. I will explain my reason with more detail in the next section. Briefly, when using the first approach, if I want to release improvements of the solution or to add some features, I would have to work on my code base, rewrite specifications, wait for the developer team to update the solution, etc This can take months. A fast cycle would imply to minimize hands-off. Maintaining and improving the pipeline Ok, now my pipeline is in production. However, it is important to create a process to capture the feedback of the operator to continuously improve the solution. For instance, The operator is using the product daily but he proposed some improvements for the algorithm. For instance, instead of predicting if a failure would occur, he prefers to have a score or a probability of failure. To derive a score from the prediction, it would require a minor change in the pipeline. Just returning the probability instead of the predicted class. What I try to do is to set up a feedback process as soon as the first version of the pipeline is accessible (sprint 2-3). This feedback loop would also help me to adjust over the sprints but when the product is released, this continuous improvement remains. To have a good interaction with the user, I want improvement to be released as fast as possible. For that reason, I avoid the hands-off strategy to do the improvement myself and get feedback faster. The feedback loop is also important to capture the decisions made by the operator. When decisions don't match the prediction of the pipelines, it means we can improve the pipeline by incorporating the &quot;reasons&quot; the operator took his decision. Over time, the role of the operator will change and get simpler. One consequence is the ability to scale his capabilities. Ultimately, a predictive pipeline can become a prescriptive pipeline. Then, the prediction is not interpreted by the operator anymore and directly connected to take action. This introduces my last point: Company reorganization It is important to understand that introducing an AI solution in a company, will disrupt the usual way the employee would work. Sometimes, the employees' role changes and additional skills might be needed. For example, if you introduce a chatbot to help the customer support team, this team might be reduced or reallocated to other tasks. The solution might also cause some business reorientation in the client company. I have seen some companies changing their strategy from selling products to selling services because of the new solution. This is often not anticipated by the client. Sometimes, it can cause the project to stop for a while. It happened to me that the company would have been so much affected by the algorithm that the reorganization and the integration of the solution in their system would require much more investment. They finally decided not to use it. I try to introduce this subject very early in the process to make sure the client would anticipate the situation. Please feel free to connect.

        <h4>Five elements of an AI business case</h4>
        <div>
          There are five critical elements the business executive needs to include in a business case for an AI solution, and AI implementations fail if the responsible business executive does not detail these five areas.More and more business executives are facing their first AI business case. Executives such as CHROs (Chief Human Resource Officers), CFOs, CMOs, or CSCOs (Chief Supply Chain Officers).They need to create an AI business case with limited experience, if any, within their organization. The IT organization will likely handle the business case's complex technical aspects, whereas the business executive is left with detailing the AI solution's business impact.There are five critical elements the business executive needs to include in a business case for an AI solution. They are 1) the business problem solved by AI, 2) the details of the AI solution, 3) Scalability &amp; maintenance, 4) AI Financials, and 5) the stakeholders. AI implementations fail if the responsible business executive does not detail these five areas.The classical business caseHowever, before looking at these five elements, it is essential to understand that an AI project's business case will deviate from classical business cases in four distinct areas. These four areas are:First, AI is a ''discovery-driven'' investment, resulting in a business case with no clearly defined KPIs. The reason is that there is a limited history of use cases, knowledge, and data about AI implementations in most organizations. As a result, business executives need to address two challenges. First, the executive responsible for the AI project and the CFO or finance organization must understand that this is not a traditional business case. The risk profile of an AI business case is different. If the AI project risks are not made explicit, the project may get defunded. Secondly, the business case's key executives will need to determine the business case metrics and track them. These KPIs will likely be less standard KPIs or less robust in the initial business case.Second, AI projects are cross-functional projects. They often involve more business functions in addition to the IT function than the average IT project. Therefore, project and business case governance is more complex, the budget impact is broader, and the need for collaboration higher. When creating an AI business case, ensure that the project's governance is detailed, the effect on budgets across the organization is agreed upon, and the implementation plan includes dealing with the need for communication across the organization to enable frictionless collaboration.Third, ensure that the data environment is ready for implementation. AI projects far too often stall or even fail because the data is not available or not usable as-is. Information is collected for a purpose and in a format that supports a specific analysis. As a result, the data may not support new forms of analysis intended for the AI solution proposed. Every AI business case needs to highlight the importance of pre-existing quality and relevant data or include a budget to ensure that such a dataset is created as part of the business case.Fourth and last, the AI business case needs to include provisions for the appropriate skills and leadership knowledge to execute the project and subsequently manage the environment when in production. This may result in the need to hire more data science or developer expertise and include costs for developing organizational and leadership competencies.Once an organization has internalized these four differences in AI business cases, they can work on the details required in the five elements of an AI business case.Five elements of an AI business caseThere is extensive coverage of AI business case development from a technical perspective, including the challenges around the data environment, what a business case needs to consider concerning the overall system architecture, and critical security, risk, and governance. But there is only limited coverage of the business elements for the AI business case. Below are five factors to consider as part of every business case for an AI implementation.The business problem: The first but obvious question is what business problem or opportunity are you solving? While this seems a trivial question, far too often, the actual business problem is not clearly articulated. As a consequence, it becomes harder to measure the impact or result of the project. This statement applies to any project, but because most organizations are still learning about AI's use and effects, it is even more critical for AI projects. A clear articulation of the business problem to be solved and how to measure the project's impact is the first step to get approval for an AI project, especially if the finance organization is not experienced in ''discovery-driven'' investments.The solution: Spending time on detailing the actual AI solution is the second area of focus. This is critical for several reasons. These include the fact that most projects are new to the organization, so what the solution is, how it will work, at scale, and who will be involved in using the solution will be new to the organization. Ensure that the solution fits as part of the organization's overall strategy and is linked to the key leaders'objectives and their organizations implementing the solution.Scalability &amp; Maintenance: Most AI projects are initiated as a smaller POC project with the intent of scaling the solution rapidly. The business case must outline how to scale the solution, technically, business-wise, and on the required skills. Lastly, the necessary training and development needed within the organization implementing the solution. Furthermore, maintenance of the full-scale solution is more complicated with AI projects since the algorithms evolve as well the regulatory and legal environments around AI. Lastly, be realistic with the timelines for the scalability of the AI project. An initial review of projects over the last three years shows that most organizations are overly optimistic about implementation and scalability timelines.Financials: The AI business will need to be approved by the finance organization, as is the case for any project. Given that most AI business cases lack well-proven and standard data and metrics used in traditional business cases, the finance organization will often challenge the business case because it is a ''discovery-driven'' investment. Consider whether simulating data where non exists could be a possible option. Approaching the AI business case as a venture capitalist is a wise approach, thus assuming less qualified KPIs, a clear, quantifiable identification of risks, and an iterative approach to proving the business value as you scale the solution. Lastly, the business case's financial part should also define possible failure criteria, so these are clear from the outset.Stakeholders: AI projects involve more stakeholders than traditional IT projects. In addition to several entities within the IT organization, there will be several business stakeholders. The critical stakeholder will be the organization implementing the solution, but the HR organization and the legal organization will likely need to be involved. Thus, ensuring a broader stakeholder communication plan and continuous reporting is a critical part of the AI business case.There will be other factors to include in an AI business case, but the five above are the most critical to have in the business case any organization builds. Also, understand that all business case documents should be treated as live documents, especially AI business cases.CEOs and senior business executives need to appreciate that AI business cases will differ from traditional business cases in several ways. This is one of several critical areas that need to be addressed if AI implementations are to scale across all organizations' sizes.

        <h4>Demant A/S: Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids</h4>
        <div>
          30.11.2020 07:59:36 CET | Demant A/S |
    Investor NewsInvestor news30 November 2020 Demant announces launch of new flagship hearing aids  Greater Copenhagen, Denmark - Today, Demant, a global leader in hearing healthcare, is announcing the launch of new groundbreaking hearing aid technology in all its four hearing aid brands, Oticon, Philips Hearing Solutions, Bernafon and Sonic. The launch of new innovative hearing solutions strongly supports Demants purpose of delivering life-changing hearing health to people living with hearing loss. The new products will be launched in all major markets in the coming months and support millions of people in enjoying life to the fullest. Oticon is launching the new, revolutionary Oticon More, which is the worlds first hearing aid that allows users to hear all relevant sounds thanks to an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More is powered by an entirely new chipset, PolarisTM, boasting an eightfold increase in memory and twice the processing power compared to the previous generation, Velox STM. The all-new Polaris platform features seven processing cores, and due to its unique architecture, the 28 nanometer chipset delivers superior processing capabilities while optimising power consumption. Through years of innovation, research and collaboration with leading research institutions around the world, Oticon has built unique knowledge and understanding of how the brain perceives sound. Contrary to common belief, it is now established that the brain needs access to all sounds in the environment to function optimally. By applying this knowledge to hearing technology, we enable the hearing aid users to enjoy more complete sound landscapes and simply get more out of life when they use our products, says Søren Nielsen, President and CEO of Demant. In 2016, Oticon presented a paradigm shift in hearing care with Oticon OpnTM, which, for the first time ever, allowed users to get access to all speakers in the sound landscape to allow for better understanding and participation. This groundbreaking approach is fundamentally different from what traditional hearing aids do, as they apply directionality and only focus on the speaker in front, while suppressing all other sounds. Then, in 2019, the paradigm was further developed with the breakthrough feedback prevention system of Oticon Opn STM. With Oticon More, Oticon is now taking the next big step on its BrainHearingTM journey by introducing the worlds first purpose-built hearing aid platform with an on-board Deep Neural Network. Oticon More utilises the intelligent capabilities of a Deep Neural Network to mimic the way the brain functions. It handles sounds based on the experience and training it has received. The Deep Neural Network in Oticon More is so much more than standard AI software - it is a unique and dedicated hearing aid solution, developed for real-time operation in everyday life. Based on our vast sound processing experience, we have trained the Deep Neural Network with 12 million sound scenes from real life. This optimises the way Oticon More makes sounds more distinct by working seamlessly across varying listening environments with unparalleled precision and clarity, while ensuring that the sound is comfortable for the user. With this integrated intelligence, Oticon More has learned to recognise all types of sounds, their details, and how they should ideally sound to optimally support the brain. As a result, Oticon More delivers 30% more information to the brain than Oticon Opn S, while reducing the listening effort of the user and improving speech understanding by 15%. Delivering breakthrough innovation and hearing care that improve the lives of people with hearing loss is what we are all about at Demant. It makes me proud that we are ready to launch the next generation of hearing aids that use deep learning, the most powerful of the AI techniques, to optimise hearing aid performance. Not only does it improve the brains hearing function, it also enables users to hear more with less effort, so they can enjoy and keep taking part in everyday life, says Søren Nielsen, President &amp; CEO of Demant. In addition to superior audiological performance, Oticon More features state-of-the-art direct streaming from both iOS and compatible Android devices using the ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) protocol and is prepared for the next generation of connectivity based on the upcoming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. This new, groundbreaking innovation from Oticon will be available in a miniRITE rechargeable style, in three upper price points and at four different power levels. Philips Hearing Solutions will soon launch the next generation of Philips HearLinkTM hearing aids. Featuring AI sound technology, the new hearing aid family will bring a significant change in hearing aid technology. It is developed to enable hearing aid users to connect with friends, family and colleagues, which is essential in order to live a social and active life. Philips HearLink is rechargeable, is able to stream directly from iOS and compatible Android devices and it is prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Bernafon and Sonic will also launch new hearing aids in the coming months. Specifically, Bernafon will introduce Bernafon Alpha that features Hybrid TechnologyTM, including a revolutionary approach to signal processing that always chooses the most optimal performance based on a precise analysis of the listening situation. Sonic will introduce Sonic Radiant, which comes with technology that actively finds, filters and fine-tunes sound so that the user can make the most of every moment. Both products feature direct streaming from iOS and compatible Android devices and are prepared for the coming Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Over the coming weeks and months, the new flagship hearing aid families of our four hearing aid brands will be launched in all major markets. The products will be available in a range of price points and power levels - all based on the powerful miniRITE rechargeable style, which is built on state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. Starting today, our sales organisations will host a series of local launch events, conduct training sessions and launch marketing campaigns. Demant will host a virtual, live-streamed webcast today at 11:30am CET where key employees will present the new products in greater detail. The event can be accessed through this link. To ask questions, please use one of the following dial-ins: +45 3544 5577 (DK), +44 3333 000 804 (UK) or +1 6319 131 422 (US). The pin code is 63665047#. The event is scheduled to last up to 90 minutes, including a Q&amp;A session.  Further information:Søren Nielsen, President &amp; CEOPhone +45 3917 7300www.demant.comOther contacts:Mathias Holten Møller, Head of Investor RelationsChristian Lange, Investor Relations OfficerTrine Kromann-Mikkelsen, VP Corporate Communication and Relations Demant is a world-leading hearing healthcare group that offers solutions and services to help people with hearing loss connect with the world around them.

In our outlook for 2021, we assume that the global hearing healthcare market will gradually normalise during H1 supported by the global roll-out of coronavirus vaccines, which will make it possible to lift coronavirus-related restrictions in developed markets. However, we expect a slower pace of normalisation in certain government channels and in emerging markets and for the latter, normalisation may  even go beyond 2021. Furthermore, we assume that some pent-up demand for hearing healthcare solutions will be released, predominantly in H2, and despite strong comparative figures for 2020, we expect that the demand for headsets will continue to grow in line with structural growth trends of 8-10%.Group organic growth23-27%, with Hearing Healthcare realising a higher organic growth rate than Communications.                                                                                                                                                   Group acquisitive growth1% based on revenue from acquisitions completed as of 8 February 2021.Group exchange rate growth-2% based on exchange rates as of 8 February 2021 and including the impact of exchange rate hedging.EBITDKK 2,850-3,150 million, with EBIT skewing towards H2.Effective tax rateAround 23%.GearingGearing multiple at the end of 2021 in line with our medium- to long-term target of 2.0-2.5 measured as NIBD relative to EBITDA.*Share buy-backsMore than DKK 2 billion.* Our gearing target no longer excludes the impact of leasing. The target remains unchanged if adjusted for the estimated impact of leasing on our gearing of 0.3.I am pleased to see how well the entire global organisation has steered Demant through a year impacted by the worst ever market conditions for hearing healthcare. The first half-year was tough, but in the second half, we saw strong recovery for the Group, not least thanks to the success of our new brand in premium audio solutions, EPOS. At the same time, we successfully managed costs, and particularly in the second half-year, we saw strong cash flows. Having now entered 2021, our business is showing good resilience, despite abnormal hearing healthcare market conditions, and all our business areas are ready to capture market shares. So, with our proven business model in place and vaccines rolling out, I take an optimistic view on the coming year where many factors will contribute to good growth, such as the release of pent-up demand and our recently launched flagship products in all our hearing aid brands. So far, Oticon More, the worlds first hearing aid using a deep neural network - AI technology - has been rolled out in most major markets where it has seen strong traction. Oticon More will no doubt be an important growth driver in 2021, says Søren Nielsen, President &amp; CEO of Demant.Demant will host a conference call on 9 February 2021 at 14:00 CEST.

        <h4>The Fascinating Relationship between AI and Neuroscience</h4>
        <div>
            They inspire and advance together which benefits both fields. Hong Jing Khok Ph.d. student Alibaba 2. apr 2020 04:47 Brødtekst With so much at stake, the need for the field of neuroscience and AI to come together is now more urgent than ever before. - DeepMind In this article, we are going to explore this topic in two ways. How neuroscience inspires AI and how AI advances neuroscience. How neuroscience inspires AI Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence. It has been an inspiration for building human-like AI. There are two ways that neuroscience inspires us to design AI systems. One, that emulates human intelligence, and two, to build neural networks that mimic brain structure. AI systems that emulate human intelligence Recent artificial intelligence advancements are taking the media by storm by performing impressive feats such as: These machines can perform tasks and solve problems better than us, achieving performance that rivals or even exceeds human capability. However impressive these may seem to be, they are only designed to excel in their intended functions. We are still decades away from building artificial human intelligence. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these artificial intelligence systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. For a machine to learn or think like a person , it would need to be able to: explain and understand problems learning-to-learn for acquiring knowledge generalise knowledge to new tasks and situations In a study by KAIST , researchers have developed a computational and neural mechanism for human meta reinforcement learning. As humans, we can adapt to complexity and uncertainty when we are making decisions. Researchers aim to build models that can make decisions like us and solve problems in the same way that humans do. Their discoveries have opened up the possibility that advances in technology might lead to building machines that are more human-like. It is an ongoing pursuit to build machines that have truly human-like learning abilities and cognition, that can learn and think as we do. For example, even with our eyes covered, we may still play the guitar well. But for an artificial intelligence system to play the guitar in a new environment (i.e. with &quot;eyes&quot; covered), it might not do as well. Build neural networks that mimic brain structure We borrowed inspiration from the structure of a human brain to design the neural networks we know today. The idea of neurons in neural networks has similar characteristics to the biological neurons in the brain. A human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, each individually linked to other neurons. Biological neurons are cells: when one gets activated, it generates a spike and sends signals to other neurons. Like a human brain, the machine learning neural network also consists of interconnected neurons. When a neuron receives inputs, it gets activated and it sends information to other neurons. Illustration: wikipedia Illustration: wikipedia artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons [ wikipedia ] Our brain's plasticity allows us to learn and improve our skills. Every time we learn new things, we are creating and strengthening the connections between neurons. That's why when we practise a task, we become better at it. Similarly, a neural network learns when we feed it with lots of data. Each connection on the neural network is associated with a weight that dictates the importance between neurons. During the training process, the weights are tuned accordingly to strengthen or weaken the connection between neurons. For example, when we look at a picture of a cat, we know that it is a cat because we have seen enough cats in our lives. Likewise, if we provide our neural networks with enough cat images, it will start to recognise cats. After understanding how neuroscience inspires AI in emulating human intelligence and building neural networks that mimic brain structure, we are going to explore how AI, in turn, advances neuroscience. How AI advances neuroscience Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming an invaluable tool in neuroscience. It helps us to understand how the human brain works and to accelerate neuroscience development. AI helps us to understand how our brain works Neuroscientists are researching how the human brain processes thoughts and how it moves our bodies. By knowing more about the brain, we are equipped to better diagnose mental diseases and enable people with disabilities to improve movement capabilities The advancement of artificial intelligence systems can help drive neuroscience forward and unlock the secrets of the brain. It allows neuroscientists and researchers to build better models to simulate the human brain. Neural networks are acting as &quot; virtual brains &quot; that capture the representation of our brain. These virtual brains can produce patterns of neural activities that resemble the patterns recorded from the brain. These patterns allow neuroscientists to test hypotheses and observe the results from simulations before investing more resources for actual testing on animals and humans. However, the way artificial intelligence systems work is vastly different from our brain. Neural networks are only a rough analogy of how the brain works, it models neurons as numbers in a high dimensional matrix. But in reality, our brain is a piece of sophisticated biological machinery that uses chemical and electrical activity. That makes us different from machines. AI accelerates neuroscience development and discoveries Machine learning's main strength lies in the ability to recognise patterns in complex data. Complexity is especially true when it comes to analysing our human minds. The signals from the brain are really complicated. With the advancement of machine learning, neuroscientists are cracking the secrets of how billions of brain neurons work together. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures activity in our brain by detecting changes in the blood flow. It generates high dimensional snapshots of brain activity every second. Using machine learning to analyse data helps to uncover the patterns in brain activities which speeds up research work. Machine learning also helps us develop applications that were thought not possible before. Korean University designed an experimental environment for controlling a lower-limb exoskeleton. Users can control the exoskeleton by focusing their attention by staring at blinking lights. Neuroscience and artificial intelligence The human brain is the paramount inspiration for building human-like artificial intelligence. AI researchers use ideas from neuroscience to build new algorithms. On the flip side, artificial intelligence accelerates research in neuroscience. Neuroscientists learn from the behaviour of artificial agents to interpret our brains. I'm optimistic about the future of this partnership between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We urge researchers in neuroscience and AI to find a common language, allowing a free flow of knowledge that will allow continued progress on both fronts. - DeepMind This was orginally posted on my blog where you can find more posts about AI and my research.

        <h4>Asia Electronics Sector Booms, Bucking Global Economic Slump</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Global trade data in the Covid-19 era has been generally abysmal, but look a little closer and the electronics sector that fires Asia's trade engines could be headed for a pretty good year. In South Korea, semiconductor exports rose in May and imports of equipment used in producing semiconductors surged 168%, trade ministry data show. Taiwan's electronic-component exports, which include chips, grew 13.2% in May to $10.2 billion, even as total exports fell 2% from a year earlier. The electronics industry is holding up relatively well amid the pandemic as companies adopt new technologies -- including 5G equipment and automation tools -- that make it easier for employees to work remotely. A sustainable boost will depend on whether consumers return with similar vigor, and whether other factors such as U.S.-China tensions don't interfere with digital demand and supply. &quot;The tech industry seems to have decoupled from the overall economy somewhat, as the tech industry is still growing well&quot; and has been &quot;relatively immune to Covid-19,&quot; Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said at a shareholder meeting June 9. Read More: Little-Known Data Show Signs of a Tech Bounce: Tim Culpan TSMC, the main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., still plans to spend as much as $16 billion on capacity upgrades and technology this year, and expects revenue gains in the mid- to high-teens, Liu said. Covid-19 has helped drive some budding technologies related to remote work and education and social distancing, he added. TSMC shares have risen 25% since their lowest close for the year on March 19, less than the 30% gain in Taiwan's benchmark Taiex stock index in that time. TSMC shares were down 2.2% as of 1:32 p.m. Monday, compared to a 0.98% drop in the Taiex. Amid generally awful export figures from the region, &quot;the one bright spot is semiconductors,&quot; said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. &quot;A lot of this reflects the product cycle and also the global lockdown and suppression that favor the 'digitalization' of economic activities, driving demand for electronic goods like chips.&quot; Budding Technologies For economies like South Korea and Taiwan that rely on tech exports, &quot;the upturn in demand for electronics has been a pillar of support amid the coronavirus pandemic,&quot; said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics Ltd. &quot;However, the improvement in the tech sector won't be able to offset significant demand weakness in non-electronic exports,&quot; he said, adding that even the surge in PC demand &quot;could be a one-off,&quot; attributable to the sudden shift to telecommuting during the pandemic. Still, it helps that some of Asia's most tech-focused economies have had relative success in containing the virus: Taiwan has reported just seven virus deaths, South Korea flattened its curve fairly early and Singapore's fatality rate is among the world's lowest. That gives momentum to efforts to restart tech engines and get consumers used to new ways of doing business. &quot;We're seeing more countries pledging economic reforms, and there's increased urgency for a stronger technology push to lead the economic recovery,&quot; said Zhao Defa, an economist at Continuum Economics in Singapore. &quot;Given that South Korea and Taiwan are the world's main semiconductor producers, they will be beneficiaries.&quot; Some of the boom is specific to the health crisis, amid a global scramble for medical equipment and demand for video-conferencing and other technologies as work and school shift more to people's homes. China's medical exports and shipments of high-tech electronics jumped in both April and May, for example, while Singapore's pharmaceutical shipments surged 174% in April from a year earlier. Further gains may not be as pronounced. Consumer demand is still lagging, though. South Korean shipments of computer products jumped 83% in May, their eighth straight monthly gain, but sales of smartphones dropped 22% and consumer appliances fell 37%. Globally, smartphone shipments are expected to fall 11.9% this year -- their biggest annual drop ever, according to data from research firm IDC. While 5G, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence will all create demand for Taiwan's exports, setbacks from Covid-19 and U.S.-China tech tensions could constrain that progress, Beatrice Tsai, director-general of the statistics department at Taiwan's Ministry of Finance, said June 8. Still, analysts at Citigroup Inc. see a risk that U.S.-China tensions will weigh on chip demand. China's buildup of chip inventories was intended partly to get ahead of a U.S. ban on Huawei set to take effect later this year. China's export orders have taken a hit from lockdowns in the U.S. and key European markets, said Rajiv Biswas, APAC chief economist at IHS Markit. A second-half recovery in those economies, as well as Christmas orders, could drive a rebound in tech exports, he said. Governments have tried to stay focused on the long view, aiming to take advantage of the tech sector's relative advantage in the pandemic by providing special support for electronics firms and new technologies. Singapore pledged S$500 million ($360 million) last month to help businesses in their digital transformations, including moving hawker center stalls to e-payments, and is spending another S$3.5 billion on information and communications technology to mitigate the virus outbreak. When the virus's spread threatened Vietnam's burgeoning tech industry, the government granted an exception to its otherwise strict lockdown measures: Samsung Electronics Co., which makes about half of its smartphones in factories near Hanoi and is one of Vietnam's largest investors, was allowed to shuttle in more than 1,000 engineers from South Korea. &quot;The recovery will be digital,&quot; Anand Swaminathan, senior partner and head of McKinsey Digital in Asia, said in a June 9 interview. Asian governments are &quot;all starting to figure out what their investment strategy is on digital.&quot; (Updates market levels in sixth paragraph, adds analyst quote in eighth and ninth paragraphs.) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Six ways that technology is changing our homes</h4>
        <div>
          The future is here and it's happening in your home. Adrian Weckler explores how the latest devices will make our domestic life run more smoothly1 Most homes are becoming 'smart homes' without us even knowing itYou might think that smart homes are entities owned by people in California or Sweden. But a smart home is simply an ordinary home with some bits that let you control them from a phone or which enable various systems to 'talk' to one another. Like your lights. Or your alarm. Or your heating system. The most common examples are products such as the Nest smart thermostat (?269), which connects to your heating system and then runs it according to how cold it is or by what time it is. Alternatively, it runs things based on whether you're in the house or not. Products like Nest are programmable from your phone and can do a huge number of things, based on other conditions occurring around them. It analyses the times that you use your heating and starts to suggest times when you might not need your heating on. It does this using sensors and software. The company claims that most of its thermostat users end up with lower heating bills.2 Almost all household appliance lines are starting to come with some form of online connectivity or artificial intelligenceYou may not yet own an internet fridge, a robotic vacuum cleaner or a web-connected washing machine. But judging by the production plans of the major manufacturers, you probably soon will.Take hoovers. A growing number of the major brands now have one model in their line-up that is designed to go around your house by itself, cleaning. Dyson's 360 Eye model may be the best in class, but Samsung, Roomba and others are close behind.Using a combination of sensors, cameras and artificial intelligence, these cleaning machines are increasingly independent of manual management: you just set them down and away they go, navigating various obstacles in your rooms. And they can be monitored via your phone through your home's WiFi.Fridges are slowly getting the connected treatment, too. Samsung's newest model uses a combination of cameras and sensors to tell you when certain foods appear to be going off. They can also be checked via your phone from a supermarket, to let you see whether you're running low on milk or eggs.Cookers are developing in slightly different ways. New models from Miele, for example, come with advanced sensors that measure the size or proportion of food you're preparing and then cook them for the adjusted amount of time. The idea is that you never under-cook or overcook a roast chicken again. (For those who worry about the lost art of cooking, manufacturers are betting that for every culinary masterpiece you lovingly prepare for dinner party comrades, there are five or six more prosaic dishes that you just have to knock out on week days for your family.)And even if you don't want to invest in a new home appliance, some manufacturers are now making add-on gadgets that turn old appliances into new connected ones. For example, LG's SmarthinQ sensor can measure things like vibration on the outside of a washing machine or movement on a safe door. The idea would be to let you know when a washing cycle is finished or when someone has opened a safe.3 Voice controls are probably the waY of the futureWe've all seen the way that Star Trek officers control machines - from on and off orders to complex questions - by speaking commands out loud. That process is well under way in the real world. The early adopters are devices such as Amazon's Echo and Google's Home, which take voice orders from you to control WiFi-connected systems around the house (including your lights, music streaming and heating). They also act as voice-controlled interfaces for common queries and internet searches, talking back to you. Apple and Microsoft aren't far behind, plotting to integrate home devices with Siri and Cortana, respectively. These systems aren't for the paranoid, however: because they are 'always listening' in your home, there are more than a few fears about surveillance vulnerabilities.4 Not everything needs to be connected to your phoneSome smart gadgets don't need humans to tell them what to do anymore. They're starting to talk to each other. Specifically, some of them are using an emerging standard called IFTTT ('IF This, Then That'). This is a system where one connected devices does something - switches on a light, for example - while another one detects something else happening. For example, if a sensor on a door detects movement, another sensor attached to a lamp or the radio or the heating might turn one of those things on. There are umpteen household products and gadgets adopting this standard, such as Philips Hue lighting, Nest's Thermostat, Amazon Echo, WeMo smart plugs and more.5 Lots of this stuff is very affordableThere's a lot you can get for less than ?100. One of the cheapest and easiest ways to make almost any device in your house 'connected' is to attach it to an inexpensive 'smart' plug. Belkin's WeMo plug is probably the best example here. Costing around ?40, it basically connects whatever is plugged into it to your phone (via a free phone app). At a minimum, it allows you to switch it (and therefore whatever is connected to it) on and off from your phone, wherever you are. But you can also program it. For example, you can ask it to keep track of when the sun goes down (by checking online) and to switch itself on when this happens. So being 'connected' is now a common, affordable reality: you already own most of the tools needed to make it happen.6 Even luddites will be tempted by new wave home security systemsEnquired about a home security alarm recently? Most of them now come with pretty advanced remote monitoring capabilities. Off-the-shelf options are popular too. There are umpteen webcams on the market that give a live feed to your phone from wherever you place one in your home. These not only let you have a look at what's going on in real time, but they also now have motion detectors that send your phone alerts if any movement is detected. Some such webcams even store clips for you online so that it can't be gotten around simply by being smashed. Webcams are also very handy for keeping tabs on sleeping infants. Then there are things like smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Some of today's 'smart' models have beefed up sensors that can tell the difference between too much steam and smoke and eliminate other 'false positives'.Sunday Independent

        <h4>The U.S. Gets Serious About Catching Up to China in R&amp;D</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a few years now, commentators (including myself) have been calling for a big boost in research spending by the U.S. federal government. In their book &quot;Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream,&quot; economists Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson called for devoting $100 billion a year to develop a network of new research centers around the country. A team at the Brookings Institution came up with a more modest but still substantial plan for $10 billion a year, funneled through universities. Big ideas like this often tend to languish for years or decades before legislators decide to take a stab at implementing them - if they ever do. In this era of partisan posturing, that seems especially likely to happen. But amazingly, a bipartisan group of legislators is acting on the idea of major new research spending. The Endless Frontier Act would spend more than $20 billion a year on upgrading the National Science Foundation, to be renamed the National Science and Technology Foundation, with greatly expanded missions, powers and facilities. Drawing on plans like those of Brookings and Gruber and Johnson, the agency's new technology directorate would create a series of research centers, based at existing universities, focusing on 10 key areas of technology. This is a great move because leveraging existing universities will yield much more bang for the buck than trying to build new research parks. It will also help preserve research universities and the college towns around them. For the past few decades, universities have counted on increasing tuition to fund faculty salaries, graduate-student stipends, new research facilities and other research inputs. But enrollment of high-paying foreign students and state university funding both probably are in long-term decline. So federal funding needs to step in to sustain the research that in turn sustains both U.S. technological leadership and regional economies. One thing that's encouraging is that the Endless Frontier Act also budgets $2 billion a year for creating technology hubs in economically distressed regions (though it's not clear yet what form those hubs would take). The new bill also recognizes that simply throwing money at research problems isn't always the best way to make progress. Many of the key government-funded innovations over the past few decades, including the internet itself, have come from the legendary Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA uses a unique model for organizing research projects: giving free rein to powerful program directors, pulling in researchers from across different institutions and fields, and focusing on specific goals. The technology directorate of the proposed NSTF would have the ability to organize DARPA-like projects in addition to traditional research efforts. If enacted, the Endless Frontier Act would help revitalize the U.S. economy at the national and regional levels and preserve institutions of higher education. But it has one more important goal: keeping the U.S. ahead of its new rival China in the emerging technology race. The U.S. cannot maintain its technological lead simply by kneecapping China with export restrictions or by putting a halt to Chinese espionage, it also needs to invest vigorously in its own capabilities, just as China has done. Big investments in research were one of the key ways that the U.S. won the original Cold War against the Soviet Union, and this contest will be no different. Many of the areas of research named in the act are either things China has invested aggressively in or things that would help U.S. industry stay ahead of Chinese competition - artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, biotechnology and so on. There are two possible concerns about the plan. First, even with more than $20 billion a year, it isn't enough to restore U.S. technological leadership - at least, not if the Cold War is any guide. Federal research spending has declined from 1.2% of gross domestic product to only 0.8% since the late 1980s, and $20 billion is only 0.1% of GDP. Ideally, the Endless Frontier Act will be only the start. The initial spending, although substantial, will actually be a proof of concept that can be scaled up later once the new directorate is created and researchers learn how to put the new flows of money to productive use. Second, some scientists worry that a greater focus on technology and mission-oriented, DARPA-style research will detract from the NSF's traditional pursuit of basic research. But this probably isn't something worth agonizing over. The Endless Frontier Act would actually boost the budgets of the NSF's existing science directorates, which work on basic research and traditional approaches. Investing in applicable technologies and mission-oriented projects is a complement to traditional basic research, not a substitute. In fact, accidental discoveries made by scientists working on applied technologies can even create new directions for fundamental research. A big push for federal research spending is one of the most obvious things the U.S. government could do to both benefit the U.S. economy and restore U.S. tech dominance. This bipartisan plan is a very encouraging sign that the U.S. isn't content to slip grumpily into decline.

        <h4>Disparate impacts in AI implementations</h4>
        <div>
          Every day, more and more decisions are made across the enterprise, and many of these decisions are made by algorithms within AI systems. Humans can unconsciously bring biases into their decision-making, and we must ensure that these are not reflected or further emphasized in our AI decision-making process. AI has the potential to help reduce unfair biases and help us ensure responsibility in our decision making to avoid disparate impacts.Biases can be both intentional and unintentional, so we need to understand where they may pop up. One example of unintentional bias is commonly shown through disparate impact (also known as indirect discrimination).Disparate impact is when policies, rules, and outcomes disproportionately impact a specific group of individuals, though there are no underlying intentions to do so. Unintentional bias is particularly important to address as it can be quite harmful to different groups of people in our society.Unintentional proxy discriminationAn example where there has been a long history of bias is within the financial services industry, specifically within the determination of creditworthiness. It is essential for financial institutions to determine consumer risk when pricing their financial service, many times looking deep into their customers' history.Many countries and jurisdictions have laws that prevent financial institutions from basing their pricing policies on certain characteristics (race, gender, age, marital status, etc.). While the algorithm might not be using a gender variable directly in its decision-making process, it can still use gender proxies.A proxy for gender could be found in a person's purchasing history, for example, the type of deodorant or razors purchased. Unintentional proxy discrimination should be monitored in these systems as well.AI has the potential to help us to detect and correct these biases. Disparate impact can be addressed through disparate impact assessments and fairness assessments. Fairness can be challenging to define, so it is important to decide on different fairness metrics and standards for each AI project implemented.Regulatory adherenceAddressing disparate impact and fairness is not only the right thing to do but is also essential in terms of regulatory adherence. Having a system in place that helps ensure you meet regulatory requirements can help with both reputational and business risks in the short and long term.It is essential to highlight the principal role of human involvement in the AI process. We are in a unique position to understand the nuances of the outcomes, the data collection process, and other steps in the AI model process. By working in tandem with the algorithms, there is a lower chance of bias making it through the system.Tools &amp; impact assessmentsThere are several top of the line open-source libraries that help assess and evaluate the presence and level of different biases in your models. At 2021.AI, we've implemented several of the best open source libraries into our Grace AI platform.We want our clients to have options and pick the best one for what they are looking for. We think you should have access to state-of-the-art tools that are benchmarks in the AI ecosystem. A sample of the libraries we work with on the Grace AI platform include:Impact Assessments are one way we, at 2021.AI, are introducing more human oversight into the AI model process. They can help structure a process in which the expectations, implications, and potential outcomes are weighed during the development and deployment of an AI model.Asking a different set of questions depending on the AI model and data used can ensure a more transparent process and ensure that the project leaders are assessing and checking in at each stage of the model development and deployment process.Combining the fairness tools with Impact Assessments can give a transparent overview of the AI models and their outcomes. Through informative questions and data pulled directly from the model outcomes, answers can be scaled and weighted to produce a multi-layered score.This combination can help make sure that a model's goals line up with the outcome of the model. Measuring and analyzing the bias in models leads to greater accountability, which is a key element in more responsible decision making.Being able to qualify and understand the presence of bias in your models and outcomes is the first step to reducing indirect discrimination. This removes one of the barriers to accountability and scrutiny of algorithms that can be difficult to carry out when working with opaque, ''black box'' style tools.Not only is it important to meet regulatory requirements, but having an unbiased and fair model can be better for business and ensure that you are optimizing your products more efficiently.Dette indlæg blev oprindeligt bragt på 2021.AI's blog.

        <h4>Where Is the Inequality Problem?</h4>
        <div>
          Reading Thomas Piketty 's influential new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century , one might conclude that the world has not been this unequal since the days of robber barons and kings. That is odd, because one might conclude from reading another excellent new book, Angus Deaton'sThe Great Escape(which I recently reviewed ), that the world is more equal than ever.Which view is right? The answer depends on whether one looks only at countries individually or at the world as a whole.The overarching fact in Deaton's book is that over the last few decades, several billion people in the developing world, particularly in Asia, have escaped truly desperate levels of poverty. The same machine that has increased inequality in rich countries has leveled the playing field globally for billions. Looking from afar, and giving, say, an Indian the same weight as an American or a Frenchman, the last 30 years have been among the greatest in human history for improving the lot of the poor.Piketty's brilliant book documents within-country inequality, with the main focus being on the rich world. Much of the cultural groundswell surrounding his book has come from people who view themselves as middle class within their own countries, but who are upper middle class or even rich by global standards.There are various arcane technical debates surrounding the facts that Piketty has established over the past 15 years with his co-author Emmanuel Saez. But I find their results persuasive, especially given that other authors, using completely different methods, have reached similar conclusions. Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis of the University of Chicago, for example, argue that labor's share of GDP has been declining globally since the 1970's.However, Piketty and Saez do not really offer a model, nor does this new book. And the lack of a model, combined with a focus on the world's upper-middle-class countries, matters a lot when it comes to policy prescriptions. Would Piketty's followers be nearly as enthusiastic about his proposed progressive global wealth tax if it were aimed at correcting the huge disparities between the richest countries and the poorest, instead of between those who are well off by global standards and the ultra-wealthy?Piketty argues that capitalism is unfair. Wasn't colonialism unfair, too? In any event, the idea of a global wealth tax is replete with credibility and enforcement problems, aside from being politically implausible.Though Piketty is right that returns to capital have increased in the last few decades, he is too dismissive of the wide-ranging debate among economists concerning the causes. For example, if the main driver is the massive influx of Asian labor into globalized trade markets, the growth model put forth by the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow suggests that eventually capital stocks will adjust and the wage rate will rise. Retirements from an aging labor force will eventually drive up wages as well. If , on the other hand, labor's share of income is falling because of the inexorable rise of automation, downward pressures on that share will continue, as I discussed in the context of artificial intelligence a few years ago.Fortunately, there are much better ways to address rich-country inequality while still fostering long-term growth in demand for products from developing countries. For example, a shift to a relatively flat consumption tax (with a large deductible for progressivity) would be a far simpler and more effective way to tax past wealth accumulation, especially if citizens' tax home can be linked to the locale where their income was earned.A progressive consumption tax is relatively efficient and does not distort savings decisions as much as today's income taxes do. Why try to move to an improbable global wealth tax when alternatives are available that are growth friendly, raise significant revenue, and can be made progressive through a very high exemption.In addition to a global wealth tax, Piketty recommends an 80% marginal tax rate on income for the United States. Though I strongly believe that the US needs more progressive taxation, particularly of the top 0.1%, I don't understand why he assumes that an 80% rate would not cause significant distortions, especially as this assumption contradicts a large body of work by the Nobel laureates Thomas Sargent and Edward Prescott.There are many practical policies that can be adopted to reduce inequality, in addition to a progressive consumption tax. Focusing on the US, Jeffery Frankel of Harvard University has suggested the elimination of payroll taxes for low-income workers, a cut in deductions for high-income workers, and higher inheritance taxes. Universal pre-school education would enhance long-term growth, as would a much greater emphasis on lifetime adult education (my addition), possibly via online courses. Carbon taxes would help mitigate global warming while raising considerable revenues.In accepting Piketty's premise that inequality matters more than growth, one needs to remember that many developing-country citizens rely on rich-country growth to help them escape poverty. The first problem of the twenty-first century remains to help the dire poor in Africa and elsewhere. By all means, the elite 0.1% should pay much more in taxes, but let us not forget that when it comes to reducing global inequality, the capitalist system has had an impressive three decades.Kenneth Rogoff , a former chief economist of the IMF , is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2014.www.project-syndicate.org

        <h4>What Do the Academy Awards, AWS and AI Have in Common?</h4>
        <div>
          Just take two little human mistakes that recently received worldwide attention because of the power of today's technology to magnify their impacts on a global scale.The first was the mistake made by a senior partner atPricewaterhouseCoopers, who was assigned to hand an envelope to an actor tasked to announce the best picture of the year. This is a task that has been performed flawlessly for decades. It is a job that has been practiced so often that a structured protocol has been established to ensure that it is handled seamlessly.Ah, but human error can occur at any point, and in this case it was caused by various distractions at the crucial moment when the handoff was scheduled to occur. Ironically, the senior partner, who probably behaves in a machine-like manner on most days, fell victim to the temptation of technology as he admitted that he was tweeting a picture at the precise time he was supposed to be handing the most important envelope to the last presenters of the evening.Amazon's CloudburstOnly a few days later, a technician working for Amazon Web Services inadvertently inputted the wrong instructions into the largest cloud provider's systems during the course of an otherwise routine maintenance process, and succeeded in knocking out a major portion of the AWS network. The simple mistake impacted countless companies and other organizations that rely on AWS to support their websites, e-commerce and other online activities.The error had a significant economic effect for those AWS customers and reignited questions of confidence regarding our over-reliance on cloud-based services. The irony in this case is that there may not be a more automated company on the planet than Amazon, and AWS has experienced unprecedented growth because of the power of its automated systems.So, do these events add more fuel to the argument that automation is a good thing that can eliminate human error and make our daily lives better and less susceptible to costly mistakes?Fourth Industrial RevolutionThe fundamental question about the value of automation has been perplexing politicians, policymakers, innovators, business leaders and the general public since the days of the first industrial revolution. Depending on how you count your technological waves, we're no closer to answering this question as we find ourselves in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution fueled by artificial intelligence and machine learning.No one can deny that the advent of automation has created greater efficiencies, along with exponential scalability that never could be matched by humans. However, even the smartest people at Tesla couldn't prevent its Autopilot-guided car from experiencing a fatal crash. Nor could Microsoft's AI wizards prevent its Tay chatbot from spewing inappropriate tweets.Now, plenty of people are lamenting that the accelerated pace of AI, ML and automated system deployment is calling into question what roles will be left for mere mortals.What's a Human to Do?The question about the proper balance between AI, ML and automation versus the human touch of real people is especially important in the rapidly changing world of customer experience and engagement. Because of the tremendous success of e-commerce, many companies and other organizations that interact with customers have set a frantic pace for adoption of the latest cloud and Internet of Things technologies to digitize their products, services and business environments.There is no denying that these new systems are creating more convenient on-demand solutions that in many cases are doing a better job of matching the products and services to meet customers'wants and needs with far less friction than their predecessors. However, as they remove the human factor from the equation, they also impersonalize the very things the technology promised to personalize in the process.Despite today's political rhetoric calling for a return to the old days, before people were replaced by machines and then watched their jobs shipped overseas, only the darkest vision of a world rid of innovation will derail the inevitable advancements of technology, automation and AI.Fortunately, there are lots of thought leaders who are working hard to paint a different picture of the future, and a growing number of real-world success stories suggest that it is possible. Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Glory Days&quot; may be gone, but a better balance can be achieved if we figure out new ways for humans and machines to collaborate with each other, rather than looking at this relationship as a zero-sum game.has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2009.

        <h4>PRM / Danish welding robot company WeldingDroid adds new owner and capital for expansion to Germany and the United States</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra WeldingDroidWeldingDroid now plans to expand from six to 30 employees at its headquarters in Vejen, Denmark, and open branches in Germany and the United States before the end of 2022. The company is poised for explosive growth as the COVID pandemic lets up, and business kicks back into high gear. Sales in the first half of 2021 already exceeds total sales in 2020.Robotics success in DenmarkThomas Visti was the owner and CEO of two of the biggest robotics successes in Denmark: Universal Robots (UR) and Mobile Industrial Robots (MIR). He was named European CEO Entrepreneur of the Year in 2019, and today he is a serial investor who has changed his focus to investing in Danish high-tech upstarts and helping entrepreneurs scale to reach their full potential.&quot;It's time to invest serious money across the board in this business,&quot; Thomas Visti said. &quot;We are talking investments in research and development, but also in sales and management.&quot;With his background in innovative robotics and a huge international network at his fingertips, it's quite a scoop for an upstart like WeldingDroid to attract an investor of Thomas Visti's caliber. But it is a good fit all the way around.&quot;WeldingDroid has a lot in common with UR and MIR,&quot; Thomas Visti said. &quot;This company has a unique product that pays for itself in a very short time. WeldingDroid is ready to scale and create some serious competition and disruption in the welding business.&quot;A WeldingDroid unit will pay for itself in 190 work hours, or just a month and half of eight-hour workdays. That means a business using WeldingDroid can outbid its usual competitors both on price and delivery time.Part of The Lions' Den - the Danish version of Shark TankAmong the other investors in WeldingDroid are two of the &amp;lsquo,lions' from DR1 TV's The Lions' Den - a Danish version of the American hit TV show, Shark Tank.Lions Jesper Buch and Jacob Risgaard invested money in WeldingDroid after an episode of the show, and they are excited to get Thomas Visti onboard.&quot;We have worked with WeldingDroid since early 2020 and we feel certain the company is ready for international expansion,&quot; Jesper Buch said. &quot;By adding Thomas Visti, we have gained a strong partner to help us scale and expand.&quot;Original owner still in chargeThomas Visti purchased 20 percent of the company but Kevin Christensen, who is the founder of WeldingDroid, still owns the majority at 22 percent. The company is based in Vejen, Denmark, where it was founded in 2019.&quot;When we first talked to Thomas Visti he had some great insights into how we were doing things and what we potentially could do differently,&quot; Kevin Christensen said, adding that Visti was concerned about Christensen burning out or losing commitment to WeldingDroid. &quot;His concern made a huge impression on me, and it showed he knows exactly how it feels to be in my shoes.&quot;What is WeldingDroidWeldingDroid can be used for gas tungsten arch welding, also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of pipes and tanks with a diameter between 100 and 3000 millimeters. WeldingDroid completely changes the well-known process of welding tanks and pipes, completing a 60-minute contemporary welding job in just 10 minutes. It also uses 75 percent less gas than ordinary welding systems and uses artificial intelligence to collect data while completing the job.

        <h4>China to Pour More Money Into Chips, AI and 5G to Catch U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence in its latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang singled out key areas in which to achieve ''major breakthroughs in core technologies,'' including high-end semiconductors, operating systems, computer processors and cloud computing -- areas in which American firms now hold sway. Beijing will also aim to get 56% of the country on faster fifth-generation or 5G networks. Nationwide R&amp;D spending will increase by more than 7% annually, which ''is expected to account for a higher percentage of GDP'' than during the previous five years, he added.WATCH: What is China's aiming for with its technology push?(Source: Quicktake)China is moving quickly to cut its dependence on the West for crucial components like computer chips, an issue that became more urgent after a global shortage of semiconductors worsened during the pandemic. Beijing is also making big bets on emerging technologies from hydrogen vehicles to biotech while looking to ensure its own chipmakers can compete with the likes of Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That encompasses a new emphasis on silicon design software and so-called third-generation chipmaking -- two areas critical to Beijing's drive to achieve technology self-sufficiency.''Innovation remains at the heart of China's modernization drive,'' Li said in an address to the National People's Congress in Beijing on Friday. ''We will strengthen our science and technology to provide strategic support for China's development.''Li's speech punctuated goals enumerated in China's 14th five-year plan, also released Friday, which prioritized advances in younger spheres such as quantum computing, neural networks and DNA banks. The document enshrines alayered strategy both pragmatic and ambitious in scope, embracing aspirations to replace pivotal U.S. suppliers and fend off Washington, while molding homegrown champions in emergent fields.Chipmakers including Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co. and China Resources Microelectronics Ltd. rose more than 3% on mainland bourses in the afternoon. But Hong Kong-listed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China's largest chipmaker, slipped in tandem with a broader global tech-shares selloff.Read more: China Sets Conservative Economic Growth Target of Above 6%At stake is nothing less than the future of the world's No. 2 economy. Beijing is moving swiftly while the Biden administration escalates a battle against what it called ''techno-autocracies.'' That could extend or even expand blacklistings that banned key transactions with corporations from Huawei Technologies Co. to ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.To a country that imports $300 billion of chips annually, a worsening global shortage drives home the risk of relying on potentially hostile suppliers for the building blocks of everything from AI to next-generation networks and autonomous vehicles. Friday's report formalized China's ambitions to develop its own software for semiconductor design -- supplanting tools from American firms Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.It also pledged to develop its own advanced chip manufacturing technologies and key materials that comprise third-generation chips. The country aims to secure first-mover advantage in that nascent arena, involving compounds such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride and chips can operate at high frequency and in higher power and temperature environments, with broad applications in fifth-generation radio frequency chips, military-grade radar and electric vehicles.While specifics of that endeavor won't emerge for months, Friday's documents provided important clues about the envisioned . That includes building more national laboratories and innovation centers, as well as ramping up efforts to implement a little-heard of program called the Sci-Tech Innovation 2030 Agenda. Beijing also revealed plans to try and entice more talent from abroad via a ''technology immigration system,'' likely targeting semiconductor hotbeds from Silicon Valley to Taiwan.Read more: China Deals Fresh Blow to Tech Giants in Reach for DataOpen sharing of data will be key, according to the report. Beijing is establishing a platform for sharing public and government data, while simultaneously crafting policies to ensure the security of that information. In a related move, the five-year plan called on technology giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to share key data, dealing a further blow to companies already reeling from heightened antitrust scrutiny.''Basic research is the wellspring of scientific and technological innovation,'' Li said. ''So we will ensure the stable functioning of funding mechanism for basic research and boost spending in this area by a considerable sum.''(Updates with share action from the sixth paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>VW Is Said to Weigh Listing of Porsche Sports-Car Division</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG is considering a separate listing of its Porsche sports-car unit in a deal that could boost its valuation and bring in a significant amount of cash, according to people familiar with the matter.The world's second-largest carmaker is speaking with advisers to study the merits of a potential initial public offering or spinoff of Porsche, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. VW could use any proceeds from a listing for acquisitions or technology investments, according to the people.Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess sounded the alarm in an interview with Bloomberg News last month about how Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle companies are cashing in on market optimism about their growth prospects. Investors have taken a dimmer view of VW and other incumbents, who will need to spend tens of billions to develop EVs while restructuring operations that revolve around combustion engines.VW's preferred shares rose as much as 6% in Frankfurt trading. At about $757 billion, Tesla's market value is roughly seven times higher than VW's 90 billion euros ($109 billion).''A Volkswagen IPO of its Porsche brand would be a bold solution to generating much-needed shareholder value,'' Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. Porsche's plan to be almost all-electric by 2030, with the exception of the 911 model, could ''attract Tesla-like multiples while generating a Ferrari-like Ebitda margin.''Dean said his analysis indicates that Porsche has a value of 110 billion euros, more than its parent.Listing TimetableA Porsche listing could take place next year, though no firm timetable has been decided, the people said. VW plans to keep a majority stake if it pursues an IPO of the business, according to the people.Deliberations are ongoing, and there's no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for VW declined to comment. Manager Magazin reported earlier Thursday that VW is weighing a listing of Porsche, citing unidentified people.VW so far has little to show for the asset review it started in 2016, in the wake of its diesel-emissions scandal, to explore options for niche brands and non-core operations. The company pushed through a downsized IPO of its trucks unit Traton SE in 2019 after internal wrangling almost derailed the project.Labor leaders and the Porsche and Piech families who own VW resisted efforts in 2017 to sell Ducati in 2017, and similar opposition emerged late last year when reports speculated the company might offload the motorcycle unit. While VW folded Ducati, Lamborghini and Italdesign into a structure that made it somewhat easier to make ownership changes, the company announced a month later that it would keep them.Valuation FrustrationValuation has been a vexing issue for Diess, 62, who set a goal in 2019 to make VW worth 200 billion euros. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company has ample cash to afford a massive budget to develop EVs and invest in the software the CEO sees as critical to the industry's future.VW already has placed bets on promising startups including battery companies NorthVolt AB and QuantumScape Corp. It also invested $2.6 billion in Argo AI, Ford Motor Co.'s autonomous-car development partner, in 2019.After Diess agitated late last year for a more comprehensive overhaul of VW and clashed with key stakeholders, the supervisory board defused the conflict by throwing its full support behind the CEO and naming several of his allies to key management posts. The company said it intended to hammer out a plan with unions by the end of this quarter to reduce fixed costs 5% by 2023 and lower material costs by 7% in the next two years.Dramatic HistoryA Porsche listing or IPO would partially reverse an acquisition concluded in 2012, when Volkswagen bought the remaining 50.1% stake in Porsche's automotive business for 4.46 billion euros. That step ended a seven-year takeover saga that divided two of the most powerful families in Germany.The two brands are historically linked through Ferdinand Porsche, the creator of the original VW Beetle. His descendants, who controlled the sports-, racked up more than 10 billion euros of debt in an unsuccessful attempt to take over Europe's largest carmaker.The two companies agreed to combine in 2009. The deal made the Porsche-Piech clan, which included the late former VW CEO Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's largest shareholders.The operating Porsche unit for which VW is considering a listing or IPO is separate from Porsche Automobile Holding SE, a holding company that has 53.3% of VW's ordinary shares.(Updates with analyst's comment in the fifth paragraph.)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>PRM / Hitachi and Centre Léon Bérard cancer center in Lyon to launch a research collaboration in the fight against cancer with AI</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra Hitachi Medical Systems Europe Holding AGLyonHitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501, &quot;Hitachi&quot;) and Centre Léon Bérard (CLB), a leading French Comprehensive Cancer Center in Lyon-France, announced today that they have entered into an agreement to jointly promote research and development aimed at improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of cancer and established a new research laboratory called Hitachi Lyon Lab on the CLB site, starting November 5th.In this collaboration, Hitachi and CLB will conduct research and development of novel technologies to detect and diagnose cancers exploiting medical images such as CT/MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and to predict response to radiation therapy using tumor genomic and transcriptomic data.According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Japan has the largest number of CTs and MRIs per million people. With the improvements of diagnostic imaging equipment, the number of images read by radiologists is increasing, and technologies that reduce the burden on radiologists using artificial intelligence are being actively developed. In addition, as a result of dramatic progress in gene analysis technology in recent years, it has become possible to analyse individual genome information at low cost, and personalized medicine that provides medical care suitable for each individual has been a key concern mainly in developed countries.Hitachi provides solutions that improve the quality and efficiency of medical care, from diagnostic/clinical fields such as diagnostic imaging equipment and particle therapy systems to informatics fields such as IT and AI. In addition, Hitachi has been contributing to maintaining and improving people's quality of life by delivering particle therapy systems to a number of world-renowned hospitals, where more than 60,000 people have been treated with Hitachi's systems so far.CLB is a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Lyon - Auvergne-Rh&amp;ocirc,ne-Alpes region, France, whose missions are care, research and education. It is affiliated to UNICANCER, the French Comprehensive Cancer Centers federation, counting twenty other cancer centers. CLB provides state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients such as innovative therapies and radiation therapy. Images, as well as molecular data from tumors, are collected and stored overtime for research purpose, upon consent from patients.Hitachi and CLB will conduct joint research at Hitachi Lyon Lab to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of cancer, by combining CLB's clinical expertise  and patient data related to cancer treatment with Hitachi's know-how in diagnostic imaging and IT/AI. Specifically, they will jointly develop diagnostic imaging technologies to detect potential cancer sites and assist radiologists' diagnosis from image data such as CT and MRI using AI. Identification of biomarkers exploiting genomic data in the context of resistance will allow to predict responses and prognoses upon radiation treatment.Hitachi will continue to accelerate global R&amp;D with advanced medical institutions and universities in the healthcare field, and will work with partners in joint research to create new value and contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of care.Kontakt:Contact:

        <h4>PRM / Leaders in cybersecurity have united to combat an unprecedented level of cyberattacks particularly targeting the healthcare sector in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra C5 CAPITALLondon, 16th March 2020: C5 Capital, the specialist investment firm that exclusively invests in the secure data ecosystem, including cybersecurity, AI, cloud and space, has created an Alliance of leading cybersecurity firms to tackle issues arising from the pandemic. There has been an unprecedented number of cyberattacks against the healthcare sector since the emergence of Covid-19, adding an additional threat level to overburdened hospitals, clinics and research facilities.The C5 Alliance - which includes leading industry companies such as ITC Secure, IronNet, Haven Cyber Technologies, Enveil, 4iQ and Blue Cedar - follows a 150% increase in healthcare cyberattacks in the last two months, such as phishing emails pretending to be from the World Health Organisation (WHO), and ransomware.Its first active response is the launch of the Collective Cyber Defence for Healthcare initiative under which C5 will provide free access for hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities in the UK and Europe to its IronDome system, the industry's first collective crowd sourcing defence product which is based on IronNet's collective defence solution. It will be managed by ITC Secure's 24/7 Security Operations Centre (SOC) based in London.Through its existing networks, the powerful industry Alliance is already providing access to IronDome for leading healthcare organisations working at the forefront of the epidemic.The initiative will help ensure hospitals and clinics protect their internal systems and databases for patients, healthcare workers and volunteers. It will also enable pharmaceutical research and development facilities to safeguard their work while developing a vaccine to fight the Covid-19 virus both safely and efficiently.IronDome takes the behavioural intelligence derived from cyber anomalies and shares it across an industry sector to deliver machine-speed visibility of potential threat campaigns. Using IronDome, security analysts with shared interests can work together in near-real-time to collaboratively defend their data.Andre Pienaar, Founder, C5 Capital said: &quot;Healthcare companies and organisations are facing growing threats, as seen with the NHS attacks in 2017. Now with the Covid-19 crisis they are facing an unprecedented assault from cyberattacks. This initiative takes immediate action in helping to protect health services in the UK and Europe in the best way possible, with the knowledge of some of the world's best cybersecurity experts.&quot;Sir Iain Lobban, C5 Investment Committee member and former Director of GCHQ, said: &quot;Cyber criminals are opportunity-driven: they won't waste a crisis. Creating this alliance of security professionals will help protect hard-pressed health services at this time of vulnerability.&quot;Paddy McGuinness, C5 Strategic Partner and former UK Deputy National Security Adviser for Intelligence, Security and Resilience, commented: &quot;With the dramatic spread of Covid-19 a coordinated approach to the crisis is crucial. The cybersecurity industry has a key role to play, and this initiative addresses a growing and immediate issue. We are proud to be joining forces with a host of excellent cybersecurity companies to help tackle this problem within healthcare.&quot;- ENDS -For details on accessing C5's IronDome please contact: Tessa Pereira, Chief Information Security Officer, C5 Capital at tessa.pereira@c5capital.com.Kontakt:Press Contact - C5 Capital

        <h4>Samsung Details Plans for $17 Billion Chip Facility in U.S.</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. revealed additional details about its plans to build a cutting-edge semiconductor facility in the U.S. in a filing with the Texas government, making the disclosure asthe Biden administration vows to make the security of the U.S. chip supply a national priority.The South Korean company plans to invest about $17 billion in its Project Silicon Silver and create about 1,800 jobs over the first ten years, according to an economic impact study prepared by a local consultant. Some $5.1 billion would go into buildings and property improvements, while $9.9 billion would be spent on machinery and equipment.The filing with the Texas comptroller warned the chips project is ''highly competitive.'' Samsung is evaluating alternatives sites in Arizona and New York, as well as in Korea.''Because of its strong ties to the local community and the successful past 25 years of manufacturing in Texas, Samsung Austin Semiconductor would like to continue to invest in the city and the state,'' the study said.Biden Putting Tech, Not Troops, at Core of U.S.-China Policy (1)In their first weeks in office, Joe Biden's administration has emphasized the importance of advanced technologies, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and next-generation networks. The president has ordered a global supply chain review for microchips as well as large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals and strategic materials such as rare earths.Bloomberg News first reported in January that Samsung was considering building an advanced chipmaking plant in the U.S., in hopes of winning more American clients and narrowing the gap with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company was in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Details of Samsung's discussions with local governments have since leaked out in filings and other revelations. The economic impact study was prepared by Impact DataSource LLC, an Austin, Texas-based economic consulting, research and analysis firm.The report shows Samsung's Project Silicon Silver would add approximately 7 million square feet of new space to the Austin campus, where the company has had operations for decades. It estimates that 542 new workers would move to the city, contributing to an addition of 1,626 new residents.Property tax abatements would total about $1.5 billion over 20 years at the city and county levels, while direct and indirect economic output would be about $8.6 billion and salaries would total $7.3 billion.A January filing detailed the likely timeline for the project. If Samsung chooses Austin, it would break ground in the second quarter of 2021 with the expectation that production would be up and running by the fourth quarter of 2023, it said.Separately, Samsung's current foundry plant in Austin hasn't resumed operations since Feb. 16 after it was ordered to halt operations by Austin Energy due to blackouts in the region. Power and water are back but it will take more time to fully restart operations, officials said.(Updates with timeline for project in penultimate paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Maskless Xi, China's Modest GDP Target, Hong Kong: NPC Update</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- China's most senior officials gathered in Beijing to kick off the annual full-session of the country's parliament, the National People's Congress.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang unveiled a conservative target for economic growth this year of above 6% that signals more restrained monetary and fiscal policies this year, in contrast to other major nations still pumping in stimulus. But China's new five-year plan that runs through 2025 didn't give a numeric target for average growth.What to Know:Click here to read more on this year's NPCEverything you need to knowFull NPC reports. Highlights hereA QuickTake explainer on the NPCWhat to watch out for this yearBloomberg Intelligence previews the NPC. Reaction to GDP goalHow China plans to be greener by 2025Clips of other reactions here and here. Key takeaways hereLatest developments: (Time-stamps are local time in Beijing)The opening session of the NPC at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesUpcoming Events: Foreign Minister, 5-Year Plan BriefingKey upcoming NPC events that have been announced so far include:March 7, afternoon - Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks to mediaMarch 8, 10 a.m. - NDRC Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe discusses 14th five-year plan at briefingMarch 8, 3 p.m. - NPC plenary session, with delegates listening to work reports delivered by NPC standing committee chairman, head of of the supreme court and the top procuratorMarch 11, 3 p.m. - NPC closing session. Delegates will vote on work reports, 14th Five-Year Plan, and other legislative revisions including decision on revising Hong Kong's electoral systemMaskless Xi (2:22 p.m.)Despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all - including President Xi Jinping - appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country's biggest political gathering of the year.While officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People's Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year's NPC, seen as a statement on China's virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.Delegates applaud as Xi Jinping arrives for the opening session of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesExport to Rise More Than 50% (2:20 p.m.)China's exports may have risen more than 50% in January to February, He Lifeng, head of the nation's economic planning agency, said in a group interview. Power consumption and generation increased by more than 20%, the economy kept improving in the first two months, though the external environment poses challenges to the Chinese economy, he said.Family Offices Overhaul (12:30 p.m.)Xiao Gang, former chairman of China's securities regulator, proposed revising the nation's family trust law, saying impediments such as high taxes have forced many family trusts to hoard cash rather than make investments, according to the China Securities Journal.Assets controlled by China's wealthiest people are expected to double from 2019 to 116 trillion yuan ($18 trillion) by 2025, according to UBS Global Research. But according to a Credit Suisse Group AG report in October, wealth inequality has also risen rapidly, estimating that the country had 5.8 million millionaires and 21,100 residents had wealth of above $50 million - more than any country except the U.S. - at the end of 2019.Steelmakers Optimistic (12:27 p.m.)Chinese steelmakers are optimistic for this year as the nation's efforts to decarbonize and consolidate the industry continue, the China Economic Times reported, citing steel mill executives at the National People's Congress. Demand will improve this year, benefiting from high growth targets set by local governments at the start of the 14th five-year plan, according to Xia Wenyong, chairman of Xinyu Iron &amp; Steel Group. Steel production may drop marginally after the country's pledge to cut output from a record high last year, said Li Lijian, chairman of Anyang Iron &amp; Steel Group.Feeding 1.4 Billion Mouths (12:25 p.m.)China rolled out a to boost crop production in the world's most populous nation, highlighting concerns over food security after the country imported record amounts of meat, corn and soybeans last year. Measures include creating agricultural belts devoted to large-scale farming and providing sufficient subsidies to motivate grain farmers, according to the latest five-year plan that sets out key economic and political goals through 2025.Food security is moving to the top of the government's agenda after the coronavirus pandemic and outbreaks of African swine fever raised concerns over whether China could guarantee food supplies for its 1.4 billion people. Imports of meat and grains surged last year, driving global prices higher and stoking worries over food inflation.Fresh Blow to Tech Giants (12:27 p.m.)China called on its technology giants to share key data, dealing a further blow to the companies already reeling from heightened antitrust scrutiny.Companies are encouraged to open up data related to areas from search to e-commerce and social media, in order to promote the healthy development of the sharing and online economies, according to a government report outlining the Communist Party's top priorities for the next five years. Beijing is also establishing a platform for sharing public and government data.China also pledged to boost spending and drive research into cutting-edge chips and artificial intelligence in its latest five-year targets, laying out a technological blueprint to vie for global influence with the U.S.Biosecurity (11:45 a.m.)China plans to ramp up the construction and management of biosecurity labs to prepare for future emerging diseases, while it also grapples with allegations from the U.S. that the coronavirus outbreak could have resulted from a lab leak.The country seeks to ''comprehensively enhance biosecurity governance capabilities'' by improving its monitoring and emergence preparedness, according to a document outlining major policy priorities through 2025. The report was released Friday as lawmakers from the world's second-largest economy meet in Beijing for the annual parliamentary session.More Oversight of Ant? (11:30 a.m.)China plans to step up oversight of financial holding companies and the nation's booming fintech industry, Premier Li Keqiang said, setting the tone for closer scrutiny over the next five years of behemoths including Jack Ma's Ant Group Co.The authorities will also expand an anti-monopoly crackdown and prevent the ''unregulated'' expansion of capital to create fair competition, Li said Friday at the opening of the National People's Congress. The fintech sector should be developed in a ''prudent'' manner and China aims to create a ''deviation correction'' mechanism to fix and suspend innovative financial products when needed, according to a separate plan covering policies for 2021 to 2025.China's s are walking a fine line of trying to curb risks at home while encouraging local champions as the economy opens wider to foreign capital. Fintech has become the latest target of scrutiny since the nation's leaders pledged in 2017 to clean up threats to its $53 trillion financial industry, tackling property loans, opaque wealth management products and fraud-riddled peer-to-peer lending.Overhauling H.K. Electoral System (11:16 a.m.)China is curbing the ability of democracy activists to win elections in Hong Kong, with local reports saying a vote for the territory's legislature would be delayed another year to September 2022.The National People's Congress will review a draft resolution on changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in the coming days, according to an agenda published Thursday by the official Xinhua News Agency. For weeks Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials have called for ''patriots'' to run Hong Kong, effectively signaling that anybody deemed disloyal to Beijing couldn't hold a leadership position.Carrie Lam at the opening ceremony of the NPC on March 5.Photographer: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty ImagesSeparately, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the city will amend local election legislation after China's top legislative body passes new election rules for the city's leader and lawmakers. The amendments will be tabled at the legislature for vetting, the principle of ''patriots ruling Hong Kong'' is fully in line with constitutional requirements of the city and ''One Country, Two Systems'' will be placed in jeopardy if forces that oppose China and stir up trouble in Hong Kong enter the political system via elections, she said.Tackling Housing (11:02 a.m.)China pledged to solve the housing problem in large cities at its top legislative session, as monetary loosening after the pandemic spurred a rush to real estate in the biggest hubs, pushing home affordability there to the worst ever.''We will address prominent housing issues in large cities,'' Premier Li Keqiang said. Li echoed President Xi Jinping's mantra that houses are ''for living in, not for speculation'' in the key report, signaling that policy makers may maintain a tight rein on the bubble-prone sector. ''We will keep the prices of land and housing as well as market expectations stable,'' he said.Boosting Usage of Non-Fossil Fuels (10:52 a.m.)In its 14th 5-year plan released Friday, China said it plans non-fossil fuels to account for 20% of energy use by 2025, versus 15% at the end of 2019. The country is also targeting it nuclear power capacity to increase about 40% to 70 gigawatts by 2025.China will also boost oil-and-gas exploration, expand its gas pipeline network, improve coal transportation and increase its ability to ensure supply.More Charging Stations for Electric Cars (10:40 a.m.)China aims to boost auto sales and add more charging facilities for electric vehicles this year. The government will encourage ''steady increases'' in spending on cars and ''abolish excessive restrictions'' on the sale of used vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. More car parks, EV charging stations and battery-swapping facilities will be built, and battery recycling systems developed at a faster pace, Li said.Premier Calls for Breakthroughs in Core Tech (10:29 a.m.)In his address Friday, Premier Li Keqiang outlined steps the government will take to make China into a global tech power. That includes building more national laboratories and innovation centers, as well as ramping up efforts to implement a little-heard of program called the Sci-Tech Innovation 2030 Agenda. Li also said China's R&amp;D spending will increase by more than 7% per year, which ''is expected to account for a higher percentage of GDP'' than during the previous five-year plan.Defense Budget Growth Fastest in Two Years (10:20 a.m.)China's defense spending is expected to grow 6.8% this year to 1.35 trillion yuan ($208 billion), according a budget report released today. That would be the fastest pace in two years. ''We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations,'' Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report.Boosting Trade with U.S. Allies (10:05 a.m.)China may join an Asia-Pacific trade pact comprised of key U.S. allies that former President Donald Trump exited, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday. In his work report, Li said Beijing ''will actively consider joining'' the 11-nation agreement known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It includes nations that China has sparred with recently such as Australia, Canada and Japan.China Stocks Fall 10% From Recent Peak (9:59 a.m.)A screen displays a live news broadcast of Li Keqiang speaking at the National People's Congress in Beijing on March 5.Photographer: Qilai Shen/BloombergChinese markets opened as Premier Li Keqiang was delivering his work report at the NPC and continued their recent slide, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index dropping as much as 2% at the start of trading. That put the index down 10% from a peak reached on Feb. 10. The rout has come amid growing concern that Beijing will begin to tighten liquidity conditions as the country's economy recovers from the effects of the coronavirus.Cuts in Carbon Emissions (09:43 a.m.)China will devise a plan for carbon emissions to peak by 2030 and is targeting an 18% cut per unit of GDP by 2025, according to Premier Li's work report. The nation will also aim for a 3% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP in 2021 and a 13.5% reduction by 2025.Tencent's Pony Ma Makes Proposals (09:16 a.m.)Tencent founder and Chief Executive Pony Ma, who is an NPC delegate, is attending this year's event in Beijing and submitted a proposal for better preserving China's natural resources. Ma's whereabouts have attracted attention after he skipped last year's NPC and was also absent from several major Tencent events due to health reasons.China Sets Modest GDP Target for 2021 (09:00 a.m.)China set a conservative economic growth target of above 6% for the year, well below what economists forecast, and outlined ongoing fiscal support to keep the country's recovery going. Other key economic targets include:Fiscal deficit target set at 3.2% of GDP for 2021, versus 3.6% in 2020CPI target set at 3% for 2021, versus around 3.5% in 2020Target for new urban job creation set at 11 million in 2021, versus 9 million in 2020Special government bond quota set at 3.65 trillion yuan in 2021, versus 3.75 trillion yuan in 2020©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

            (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said it will promote Jim Farley to chief executive officer on Oct. 1 to replace Jim Hackett, who has elected to retire after his three-year bid to turn around the automaker failed to gain traction. Farley, 58, became chief operating officer in March when his main internal rival was ousted following the botched launch of the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford's stock was routed under Hackett, 65, before the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the second-largest U.S. automaker's woes. Ford shares climbed as much as 3.3% during regular trading Tuesday. The stock had dropped almost 40% during Hackett's tenure through Monday's close. Read more: Ford's Stock Slump Under Hackett Exceeds Predecessor's Rout Last week, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss that was less than half the $5 billion deficit it had predicted, due in part to demand for its SUVs and trucks holding up better than feared. But some of the company's over-performance also could be chalked an on-paper gain from its investment in self-driving startup Argo AI. &quot;The wind in our sails is really starting to pick up, and Jim had a big, big role in that,&quot; Hackett said of Farley on a call with reporters. &quot;I can confident that the things I was asked to do have actually started taking root.&quot; Botched Explorer The economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 outbreak hit Ford two years into an $11 billion restructuring that Hackett drew navigate the company out of a long slump. He saw the need to update a lineup that had gotten stale under his predecessor, Mark Fields, with greater connectivity features and electrified powertrains, and pulled Ford out of passenger-car segments in North America. But the first of those major redesigns, the Explorer, went horribly awry. The Chicago plant that underwent a major overhaul to build the revised SUV was plagued by personnel problems and struggled to get the vehicle out the door. Thousands were shipped to a Michigan factory hundreds of miles away for rework. In February, Ford announced the promotion of Farley, one of the two presidents seen as leading candidates to become the next CEO. The other, Joe Hinrichs, left the company. 'Smooth Transition' Farley will take over as Ford prepares to roll out three crucial new models aimed at reversing its fortunes: the electric Mustang Mach-E, the revived Bronco SUV and a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 pickup, its most profitable model. He promised to &quot;swing for the fences&quot; as Ford's leader, vowing to return the automaker to 10% profit margin in North America -- its long-standing goal -- and to have flawless launches of new models. &quot;We know our competition today is Amazon, Baidu, Tesla, Apple, Toyota, and others,&quot; Farley said. &quot;They're well-financed and voracious companies.&quot; Ford likely will seek to restore the dividend Hackett was forced to suspend in March when the coronavirus pandemic upended economies worldwide. Management had previously said the payout was sacrosanct, and cutting it off tested the faith of the founding family that had supported the CEO. Ford also lost its investment-grade credit ratings. &quot;Nothing makes me happier than having a smooth transition,&quot; Executive Chairman Bill Ford said during the call. &quot;This is something that we've been planning for some time. And it seemed liked the right time coming out of the second quarter when we performed much better than the world thought we would.&quot; (Updates with CEO's comment in the fifth paragraph.) ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Jack Ma Becomes Richer Than Walmart Heirs With Mega Ant IPO</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma, the former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with $60,000, is poised to become the world's 11th richest person after Ant Group Co. priced shares for a record initial public offering. Ma's 8.8% stake is worth $27.4 billion based on the stock pricing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That will take the 56-year-old's fortune to $71.1 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, exceeding that of Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, L'Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and individual members of the Waltons, whose family owns Walmart Inc. Ant's mammoth listing is poised to boost the fortunes of a group of early investors and employees. The company has granted staff share-based awards since 2014 and at least 18 other people have become billionaires from the IPO. Lucy Peng, a director at the payments giant through August, is the biggest individual Ant owner after Ma, and has a $5.2 billion stake. Chairman Eric Jing's holding is worth $3.1 billion. WATCH: Jack Ma's fortune is set to surge to $71.1 billion, above Oracle's Larry Ellison and individual members of the the Walton family. Source: Bloomberg) Ant is set to raise almost $35 billion, beating Saudi Aramco's $29 billion sale last year. The Shanghai stock priced at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) apiece and its Hong Kong shares at HK$80 ($10.32) each. The company could raise another $5.2 billion if it exercises its green shoe options, taking its market value to about $320 billion. That would be more than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and four times bigger than Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The big winners of the listing own their stakes through two limited partnerships registered in Hangzhou that together hold about 40% of Ant. Alibaba, in turn, has a third of the fintech firm. Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing, the family behind a French supermarket giant, the son of a Taiwanese real estate billionaire and Chinese retail tycoon Shen Guojun are among the other owners who have invested in the company over the year. Jack Ma Photographer: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg Ant began when Alibaba launched the Alipay payments app in 2004 as an escrow service for buyers and sellers on Ma's e-commerce website. In 2013, they were given the ability to save money and earn interest on the balances stored on their accounts. The firm then started offering credit to small businesses, branching out from its consumer-finance focus, and eventually expanded to services such as block chain, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Since co-founding Alibaba with Ma, Peng served in different roles. She set up Alibaba's human-resources department and, after helping create Ant, was its chief executive officer until Jing took over in 2016. Two years later, he succeeded her as executive chairman of the fintech company. Both Peng and Jing are members of the Alibaba Partnership, a 36-person group with the power to determine the annual cash bonuses for all members of management.

        <h4>Billionaire Founder of China Property Giant Dies of Illness</h4>
        <div>
          (Bloomberg) -- The billionaire founder of KE Holdings Inc. has died of an unspecified illness, a shocking development for a Chinese property company that pulled off one of the strongest U.S. market debuts of 2020.Zuo Hui, who turned the company known as Beike from a nationwide chain of real estate offices into China's largest platform for housing transactions and services, died May 20 after an ''unexpected worsening of illness,'' his company said in a statement without elaborating. KE Holdings' board will announce follow-up arrangements within two weeks, it added.Zuo, 50, has been the driving force behind the company's success, headlining the bell-ringing ceremony when it went public and holding 81.1% of voting shares under a dual-class voting structure as of end-February, according to its annual report. The company's American depositary receipts fell 0.8% to $49.85 in New York on Thursday, paring an earlier decline of almost 10%.Zuo HuiPhotographer: Qilai Shen/BloombergZuo was backed by some of Asia's most influential startup investors, including Hillhouse Capital Group and Tencent Holdings Ltd., and ranks among SoftBank Group Corp.'s most successful bets. KE Holdings almost doubled on its August U.S. debut, vaulting Zuo into the ranks of the world's richest entrepreneurs with a fortune in excess of $20 billion at one point, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires' Index.Its shares were up 151% from their New York debut through Wednesday's close, conferring on the late chairman a net worth of $14.8 billion.In an interview with CCTV aired in April, he downplayed the significance of the IPO and the riches it bestowed.''Why should I excited?'' he said, dressed in jeans, a dark blue vest and black sneakers. ''This makes no difference to me.''Read more: Founder of China Property Site With No Profits Worth $20 BillionBorn in 1971 in Shaanxi province, Zuo graduated with a bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 1992 before getting into sales and establishing an insurance business, where he made his first fortune, according to local media. He then founded Beijing Lianjia Real Estate Brokerage Co. in 2001, when China's property market was still relatively young, and started Ziroom in 2011 to offer long-term apartment rentals. In 2018, he incorporated KE and launched Beike, becoming one of the country's most celebrated entrepreneurs.Beike uses artificial intelligence and big data to improve its service and provide market insights, according to its website. As of June, the company boasted 226 million homes on its platform and 39 million monthly active users on mobiles. That's swelled to more than 48 million mobile monthly active users and half a million agents.The platform also draws in others by allowing decorators, renovators and financial institutions to connect with buyers, creating an ecosystem of property and related offerings.(Updates with closing share price in third paragraph)©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>PRM / New EU research project: Swarms of drones to ensure safe bridges and railways across Europe</h4>
        <div>
          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra Syddansk UniversitetBy Jane Thoning Callesen, jtca@mmmi.sdu.dkWhen the Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed in August 2018, 43 people lost their lives. Three weeks later, the European Commission called for researchers to develop applications of drones to ensure safety in transport. Now, &amp;euro,3,5 million has been granted to a research project called Drones4Safety. Starting today, a consortium of researchers aims to develop a system of autonomous, self-charging, and collaborative drones that can inspect infrastructures such as bridges and railways in continuous operation without direct human involvement.Whereas the current inspection solutions are carried out by helicopters, the drone system is expected to achieve higher accuracy, reduced time and cost, and improved safety.Nine partners from across Europe are involved in the project, which is coordinated by associate professor Emad Samuel Malki Ebeid from the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute (MMMI) at the University of Southern Denmark. - We want to create a system where swarms of drones monitor infrastructure almost by themselves and report back if they notice any problems, Emad Samuel Malki Ebeid says.- But just like phones, drones need to charge regularly, so we must come up with a solid plan for energy harvesting. Preliminary research has shown that 71 percent of Europe's bridges are within three kilometers distance from high voltage power cables, and those cables can potentially be used for self-charging. The drones will also be able to &quot;eat&quot; from the rail cables when inspecting rails.- You can compare the system to a flock of birds, Emad Samuel Malki Ebeid says with a smile.- If we can get our &amp;lsquo,drone birds' to eat from the power cables, they will have the energy to fly out and monitor the terrain. We will equip them with a camera, so they can see how things stand, and through artificial intelligence, we will teach them to recognize faults and cracks. Our drone birds will fly in flocks and cooperate by using geo-tracking, and then they are to notify us if something needs to be repaired. - Drones hold so much potential, and we are interested in exploring the possibilities of energy harvesting, says Gerd Vom Bogel, dr.ing. from Fraunhofer IMS, one of the project partners.- This project is a big step to the future, and our anticipated results on both energy harvesting, artificial intelligence, and swarm systems will likely be useful to many other application areas.Teaching the drones on how to communicate with each other and work as a team will be another main challenge. Rune Hylsberg Jacobsen, associate professor from the Department of Engineering at Aarhus University, Denmark, explains how important it is for the drones to be able to cooperate on missions, work towards the same goals, and adjust to changes: - Just like birds, the drones will each have different roles. That requires a lot of new algorithms and research, which we're happy to contribute with. It's great to work on such an innovative project with skilled partners from all over Europe, he says.The artificial intelligence will partly be provided by Delair, a technology enabler providing visual intelligence solutions for enterprises. - By contributing our AI platform to the Drones4Safety project, we look forward to paving the way for developing new advanced AI based analytics for the railways and roads market, says Paolo Guzzini, Senior Product Manager Infrastructures at Delair.The project supports the UN's Sustainable Development Goals on infrastructure and sustainable cities, and data suggests that the use of drones will reduce inspection costs by &amp;euro,15 billion annually. Apart from MMMI and IMADA at the University of Southern Denmark, Aarhus University, Fraunhofer, and Delair, the project will be carried out in close collaboration with EUCentre, NEAT SL, Automotive &amp; Rail Innovation Center, Deep Blue SRL, and Eurocontrol. Starting in Italy, the consortium aims to conduct the first automatic drone inspections by the beginning of 2022.- We aim to create a system that saves time and cost and ensures consistent and sustainable inspection. But most importantly, the system can potentially prevent disasters like the one we saw in Genoa, and that is a big motivation for all of us, concludes Emad Samuel Malki Ebeid.Drones4Safety is a major European research project under the Horizon2020-program. With a grant of &amp;euro,3,5 million, researchers will develop an autonomous drone system that can monitor infrastructures such as bridges and railroads. The project will run from 2020-2023. There are five main objectives in the Drones4Safety-project: To develop a solution for energy harvesting, to increase inspection efficiency by developing AI algorithms, to provide a platform for collaborative drone operations, to develop a failsafe inspection drone, and to build a cloud-based AI system for autonomous navigation.

The findings of the Acronis Cyber Readiness Report 2020illustrate why organizations need a cyber protection solution that reduces complexity and improves security while remaining cost-effective.With Acronis Cyber Protect 15's unique integration of data protection &amp; next-generation cybersecurity capabilities - including AI-based behavioral detection that stops zero-day attacks, URL filtering, vulnerability assessments, videoconference protection, &amp; automated patch management - organizations protect against modern cyberthreats while ensuring they can recover their data and systems in the shortest time possible.Acronis Cyber Readiness Report 2020, which surveyed 3,400 global companies &amp; remote workers in the wake of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, revealed that only 12% of global employees chose full office work as an ideal work arrangement. A new normal will likely emerge. Among the 20% favoring the &quot;80% office / 20% remote&quot; split, there are the following country-level outliers: France - 33%, Spain - 29%, Switzerland - 28%, and the UK - 27%.The report also reveals that as hackers target remote workers, phishing, distributed denial of service (DDoS), and videoconferencing attacks are the most common tactics used. The findings illustrate why organizations need a cyber protection solution that reduces complexity and improves security while remaining cost-effective. The changing cyber threat landscape demands modern protection&quot;Traditional stand-alone antivirus and backup solutions are unable to protect against sophisticated modern cyberthreats in a dramatically changing environment.&quot; said Serguei &quot;SB&quot; Beloussov, founder and CEO of Acronis. Hence, organizations that modernize their stack with integrated data protection and cybersecurity not only gain greater security, but benefit from cost reduction and other scale effects. &quot;The automation and streamlined management of Acronis Cyber Protect 15 means any business can decrease their risk, avoid downtime, and increase their IT team's productivity,&quot; the founder and CEO of Acronis added.With Acronis Cyber Protect 15 organizations protect against modern cyberthreats while ensuring they can recover their data and systems faster than any other solution.

          KøbenhavnPressemeddelelse fra RSU Rating Service GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;The model was developed using the Supervised Machine Learning approach&quot;, says Carsten Demski, head of team in RSU's methodology department and in charge of the project. &quot;Based on a dataset comprising more than 3 million news reports on some 3,000 companies we've been able to develop a stable and accurate credit risk model. Note that 80% of these companies are unlisted.&quot;The new system component automatically analyses very large amounts of news information every day and flags critical messages. Analysts can then read these messages directly in Risk Guard.&quot;Risk Guard enables our customers to monitor borrowers continuously and react to signs of financial weakness. Our system is optimised for detecting such risks up to one year in advance&quot;, explains Dana Wengrzik, Managing Director of RSU Rating Service Unit GmbH &amp; Co. KG. &quot;We developed Risk Guard after many banks had been caught off-guard by the 2008 financial crisis.&quot;RSU has been operating Risk Guard since 2011. The system currently monitors risk parameters of some 3,100 exchange-listed companies and banks with which RSU's customers do business.&quot;Although our clients are very satisfied with Risk Guard, it didn't cover unlisted companies in the past&quot; says Demski. &quot;Also, we wanted to find a way of analysing news reports automatically because they simply are an important source of information in credit risk management.&quot;Risk Guard now picks up signs of elevated credit risk for both listed and unlisted companies, which saves analysts a great deal of time and work.With a long economic upturn apparently drawing to a close, banks and institutional investors are well advised to attach increasing importance to risk detection. &quot;Many banks are testing intelligent solutions for processing business news&quot;, says Dana Wengrzik. &quot;But it takes top-level expertise to develop and implement a fully operational system. Which is why we are proud to be one step ahead of even the big players in the market.&quot;Kontakt:RSU Rating Service Unit GmbH &amp; Co. KG

        <h4>China Pledges Quality Growth, Tech Powerhouse in Five-Year Plan</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- China unveiled the first glimpses of its economic plans for the next five years, promising to build the nation into a technological powerhouse as it emphasized quality growth over speed. Initial details released by the Communist Party's Central Committee Thursday stressed the need for sustainable growth and also pledged to develop a robust domestic market. The communique released by state media following a four-day closed-door meeting didn't specify the pace of growth policy makers would target. The statement elevated China's self-reliance in technology into a national strategic pillar, a move signaled by officials from President Xi Jinping down in the lead the meeting. Central to that endeavor is self-reliance in chips, the building blocks for innovations from artificial intelligence to fifth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles. Beijing's efforts are gaining urgency as the U.S. seeks to contain the rise of its geopolitical rival. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., barred dozens of China's largest tech companies from buying American parts, and even slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s WeChat. Read More: The U.S.-China Conflict Over Chips Is About to Get Uglier Unlike the last five-year plan, which sought to achieve &quot;medium-to-high growth&quot; in order to build a &quot;moderately prosperous society,&quot; this plenum had been expected to focus on the quality rather than the pace of growth. In Thursday's statement, officials pledged to stick to a strategy of boosting domestic demand and opening up the economy over the next five years. Even though the plan doesn't mention a specific rate of growth for gross domestic product, the government remains ambitious in its outlook. &quot;The leadership still expects the size of the economy, household income as well as GDP per capita to reach a 'new milestone' by 2035,&quot; said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. &quot;China did not abandon GDP targeting, it's just expressed in a more subtle way.&quot; While the strategy on &quot;dual circulation&quot; was mentioned twice in the communique, there wasn't any specific explanation or details of what it entails. The nation needs to &quot;smooth the domestic circulation, facilitate dual circulation at home and abroad, comprehensively promote consumption and expand room for investment,&quot; according to the statement. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

        <h4>Florida Posts Record Deaths GOP Convention Curbed Virus Update</h4>
        <div>
            (Bloomberg) -- Florida posted a record number of 156 virus deaths. The Republican presidential convention in Florida will be scaled back as cases in the state continue to spike.Maryland's Republican governor criticized the Trump administration's handling of the virus, saying it &quot;bungled&quot; testing. The U.K. accused Russian state intelligence of trying to steal vaccine research. Hong Kong reported a record number of cases, the third time in about a week that its new outbreak breached previous high-water marks. The number of Americans filing for unemployment barely declined last week, signaling a slowing rebound in the labor market. The European Central Bank kept its pandemic bond-buying program at $1.5 trillion, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has so far calmed markets. Key Developments: Global Tracker: Cases top 13.5 million, deaths surpass 584,900 The number of cases of unknown origin will determine lockdown responses Greenwich mansions are all the rage in the pandemic era Fewer Covid ICU deaths suggest care is improving This big law firm has permanent plans for remote working Virus fumble exposes Netanyahu when he needs to look strong Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg's Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus. Maryland Governor Criticizes Trump on Testing (10:20 a.m. NY) Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, criticized the Trump administration's coronavirus response, saying it &quot;bungled&quot; coordinated nationwide testing by leaving it to unprepared states. &quot;The president was all over the place,&quot; Hogan wrote in the Washington Post. &quot;He avowed, falsely, that 'anybody' could get a test, even as my fellow governors were desperately pleading for help on testing. Then he shifted from boasting to blame.&quot; Florida Outbreak Forces Smaller Republican Convention (10:13 a.m. NY) The Republican National Committee is scaling back its convention next month in Jacksonville, Florida, as cases of the coronavirus spike in the state and some officials said they would not be going out of concern for their safety. For the first three days of the event, only party delegates will be allowed to attend. On the final day of the four-day event, when Donald Trump accepts the party's nomination for president, the RNC will allow delegates, their guests and alternate delegates to attend, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote in a letter Thursday to members. Germany Moves to Thwart Outbreaks From Travelers (9:22 a.m. NY) Germany tightened travel rules to prevent outbreaks of the coronavirus as the summer vacation season gets under way. Federal and state officials agreed to more stringent restrictions, but stopped short of a complete ban on travel to and from domestic hot spots. U.K. Says Russians Are Trying to Steal Vaccine Research (9 a.m. NY) The U.K. accused Russian state intelligence of hacking international pharmaceutical and academic research in a bid to win the race to secure a vaccine against Covid-19. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said vaccine and therapeutic sectors in multiple countries have been targeted, declining to list the names and number of institutions affected on security grounds. Britain named the group responsible for the hacking as APT29, saying it is &quot;almost certainly&quot; part of Russian state intelligence. The group also goes by the name of Cozy Bear or The Dukes and has targeted U.K., U.S. and Canadian vaccine research and development organizations. China's Sinopharm Begins Mass Testing of Vaccine in UAE (9 a.m. NY) Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm Group began the first mass trial of a coronavirus vaccine in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm G42 will carry out the trial. The company will test 15,000 people as part of the Phase 3 trial, a milestone in the vaccine testing process that is normally followed by mass production, officials said. Chinese companies have had to look for places with active virus outbreaks to complete the final stage of human testing. U.S. Jobless Claims Post Smallest Decline Since March (8:33 a.m. NY) Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits posted the smallest weekly decline since March after coronavirus cases surged and reopenings paused or reversed across the South and West. Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 1.3 million in the week ended July 11, down 10,000 from the prior period, Labor Department figures showed Thursday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast a larger drop, to 1.25 million initial claims. Separately, U.S. retail sales exceeded forecasts in June for a second straight month as more businesses reopened and expanded jobless benefits padded the wallets of the unemployed, according to Commerce Department data. Israel Headed Toward Weekend Lockdown (8:13 a.m NY) Top Israeli ministers decided to impose a full lockdown for weekends in order to stem a rise in Covid-19 cases, according to a Channel 12 report. The plan is to shut malls and beaches, and restaurants will only be allowed to serve takeout food, the report said, adding the restrictions would be in place from Friday to Sunday mornings. Some schools would also be closed should the government pass these measures, according to the report. ECB Keeps Pandemic Stimulus Steady (7:47 a.m. NY) The European Central Bank kept its emergency monetary stimulus unchanged as the region's political leaders prepared to haggle over a plan to drag the economy out of the worst slump in living memory. ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues held their pandemic bond-buying program at 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) and interest rates at -0.5% on Thursday, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has so far calmed markets and kept borrowing costs low. Morgan Stanley Joins Gold Rush With Record Profit (7:35 a.m. NY) Morgan Stanley wrapped up a week of wins for Wall Street trading desks, capitalizing on the Federal Reserve's extraordinary rescue measures with record profit. Fixed-income trading revenue almost tripled, driving a 73% jump in total trading that surged past expectations. That spurred firmwide revenue and earnings to an all-time high amid wild market swings caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Almost Nine of Every 10 Wuhan Cases Undetected (7:30 a.m. NY) As many as 87% of Covid-19 cases in Wuhan, China, went undetected between January and March, according to a modelling study published in the journal Nature. People with no or mild symptoms probably played a major role in the coronavirus's rapid spread because they are difficult to detect and isolate, the scientists said. BofA Sets Aside Billions for Soured Loans (7:09 a.m. NY) Bank of America Corp.'s profit slid 52% as it joined rivals in preparing for an onslaught of consumer defaults spurred by the pandemic's economic fallout. Profit at the consumer-banking unit plunged 98% as the coronavirus shuttered much of the U.S. economy and caused tens of millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Nissan Plans 30% Global Production Cut (6:44 a.m. NY) Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. is planning a 30% year-on-year cut in global vehicle production through December, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. The automaker targets to produce around 2.6 million vehicles between April and December, down from 3.7 million during the same period in 2019. AstraZeneca Pressure Mounts Over Vaccine (6:10 a.m. NY) Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca Plc to deliver positive results from early tests evaluating the coronavirus vaccine it's developing with University of Oxford researchers as investors await data expected on Monday. The U.K. pharma company is staying quiet after British said results of phase 1 tests to be published in The Lancet medical journal were promising, driving the shares up late Wednesday. A paper is undergoing final editing and preparation and is due to be published on July 20. South Africa's Downward Cycle to Weigh on Households (5:27 p.m. HK) The South African economy extended its longest downward cycle since 1945 as restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus weighed on output and are set to hurt household finances even more. The economy entered the 80th month of a weakening cycle in July, according to data in the Reserve Bank's Quarterly Bulletin. That's after a nationwide lockdown that started on March 27 shuttered most activity and weighed on output. Hong Kong Sees Record Local Cases (4:55 p.m. HK) Hong Kong reported a record 63 local cases on Thursday, the third time in about a week that the city's new outbreak has breached previous high-water marks. Of the total confirmed cases, 35 were of unknown origins, the city's health department said. The new outbreak has now infected over 300 people in less than two weeks, with more than a third of infections unlinked to confirmed cases or existing outbreaks. Turkey's Budget Gap (4:34 p.m. HK) Turkey posted a budget deficit for a seventh month in June, as measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak paralyzed economic activity while spending jumped and tax deferrals chipped away at government revenue. The central government ran a monthly fiscal gap of 19.4 billion liras (about $2.8 billion) last month, bringing the deficit in the first half to 109.5 billion liras. That compares with a gap of 12.1 billion liras in June 2019 and an annual deficit of 123.7 billion liras last year. Pressure on AstraZeneca (3:59 p.m. HK) Pressure is growing on AstraZeneca Plc to deliver positive results from early tests evaluating the coronavirus vaccine it's developing with University of Oxford researchers as investors await data expected on Monday. The U.K. pharma company is staying quiet after British said results of phase 1 tests to be published in The Lancet medical journal were promising, driving the shares up on Wednesday. Signs of Trouble for U.K. Labor (3:51 p.m. HK) The number of hours worked in the U.K. economy fell the most on the record in the three months through May, underlining the risk facing the labor market as government income support is phased out. Hours plunged by 175 million, or almost 17%, to their lowest level since 1997, the Office for National Statistics said. Employment fell, vacancies dropped sharply and wage growth slowed to a virtual standstill. Bank Indonesia Cuts Rates for Second Month (3:28 p.m. HK) Bank Indonesia lowered its key interest rate for a second straight month, seeking to help the economy recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank cut its seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 4%, the lowest since the current rate system was adopted in 2016, as predicted by 18 of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. De Beers Sold Almost No Diamonds (2:41 p.m. HK) Anglo American Plc's De Beers sold sold $56 million of rough diamonds in the second quarter, down about 96% from a year earlier when sales totaled $1.3 billion. With jewelry stores closed, cutters and polishers stuck at home and global travel at a standstill, the entire diamond industry essentially came to a halt in the period. Beer, Watches Feel the Pain of Lockdowns (2:51 p.m. HK) The change in how people and companies spend their money through the pandemic reads like a tale of two economies. Quarterly earnings out Thursday are showing the hit to those on the wrong side of these structural shifts. Richemont -- heavily reliant on a decimated tourism industry -- saw almost half of its sales evaporate in the three months through June. Heineken NV reported a plunge in profit as lockdowns wiped out sales to bars and restaurants and led to a big impairment charge. Companies lucky enough to be in the winning segments of the economy, such as online fashion retailer Zalando SE and laboratory-equipment maker Sartorius AG, are riding high. Those reliant on broader economic confidence are struggling to see through the gloom, with recruitment firm Hays Plc saying the outlook is &quot;highly uncertain.&quot; Sweden Defends Controversial Virus Strategy (2:40 p.m. HK) Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he has no doubt Sweden's highly controversial strategy for fighting Covid-19 remains appropriate, even as the country's mortality rate tops the U.S. Lofven, who has seen his popularity flag as Sweden's decision not to impose a proper lockdown was followed by a spike in deaths, said he still thinks &quot;the strategy is right, I'm completely convinced of that,&quot; according to an interview with Aftonbladet. U.K. Labor Market Holds Up (2:17 p.m. HK) U.K. jobless claims fell in June and the economy lost fewer jobs than expected in the three months through May as government income support kept millions of people in work. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 28,100 to 2.63 million, and employment fell by less than half the expected drop, the Office for National Statistics said. The headline jobless rate stayed at 3.9%. Indonesia Plans to Punish Virus Rule Breakers (1:40 p.m. HK) Indonesia plans to fine violators of social distancing rules under a new law as President Joko Widodo steps up efforts to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Southeast Asia. Provincial chiefs will determine the types of punishment for offenders, Widodo told a meeting of governors in Jakarta. Earlier this week, the president told a cabinet meeting that people not wearing masks in public and those failing to maintain physical distance may be ordered to pay a fine or do social service. Tokyo, Victoria Report Daily Records (12:25 p.m. HK) Tokyo reported a daily record of 286 coronavirus cases, heightening concerns that the latest infection is spreading in the broader community and set to spill beyond the capital. The number comes after the city conducted more than 4,000 tests, also a record. While the initial flare-up in Tokyo came from nightclubs, authorities have expressed concern that more cases are now coming from more everyday locales such as restaurants, bars and workplaces. Meanwhile Victoria, Australia's second most populous state, recorded 317 new cases, its biggest spike. The increase comes a week after it was placed into partial lockdown and it's the largest single-day rise for any of Australia's states and territories, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ICU Death Rate Is Declining (8:45 a.m. HK) Overall mortality of Covid-19 patients treated in intensive-care units fell to just under 42% at the end of May from almost 60% in March, according to the first systematic analysis of two dozen studies involving more than 10,000 patients in Asia, Europe and North America. The fast spread of SARS-CoV-2, high caseload and proportion of patients requiring breathing support placed &quot;unprecedented demand&quot; on ICU services, researchers wrote in a study published Wednesday in the journal Anaesthesia. Countries in the later phases of the pandemic may now be coping better, they said. Air Canada Urges Trudeau to Relax Travel Rules (7:25 a.m. HK) Air Canada tried to persuade the government of Justin Trudeau to ease restrictions on travel, pointing to policy shifts in other nations where the pandemic has shown signs of improvement. In a letter to Transport Minister Marc Garneau and other cabinet members, the airline's chief medical officer suggested loosening quarantine requirements through &quot;a science-based approach&quot; to strike a balance between economic and public health concerns. In following some countries in Europe and Asia, Canada would enable a &quot;measured restart of aviation,&quot; he said. Record Day of Deaths in Texas (6:47 a.m. HK) Texas recorded its grimmest day yet with a record 110 Covid-19 deaths and almost 11,000 new cases, according to state health department data. The increase brought the Lone Star state's death toll since the start of the pandemic to 3,432. Hospitalizations ticked down by less than 1% statewide for just the second daily decline since late June, state figures showed. Reporting lags continued to bedevil efforts to assess the outbreak's trajectory. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in tweets that some fatalities reported on Wednesday occurred as long ago as early May. World Leaders Want Vaccine Fairness (6:10 a.m. HK) Eight world leaders including President Sahle-Work Zewde of Ethiopia and Sweden's Lofven issued a call for &quot;global solidarity&quot; for fairness in distributing any Covid-19 vaccine that may be developed. Supplies of a vaccine should be shared fairly among all nations and people of all income levels, the leaders said in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post. An organized global flow of vaccines will require &quot;mutual trust, transparency and accountability&quot; among nations, they said. Also signing the statement were prime ministers Justin Trudeau of Canada, New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Tunisia's Elyes Fakhfakh, who later resigned, as well as presidents Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. U.S. Cases Rise 2%, Matching 7-Day Average (4 p.m. NY) Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 2% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 3.47 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average gain over the past week. Deaths rose 0.6% to 136,940. Florida reported 301,810 cases, up 3.5% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 4.5% in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 4,521, an increase of 112, or 2.5%, Arizona reported 3,257 new cases, a 2.5% increase that was below the prior seven-day average gain of 2.9%. The state also reported 97 new deaths, the fifth increase in six days, bringing the toll to 2,434. Montana cases rose 7.4% to 2,096 according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.
